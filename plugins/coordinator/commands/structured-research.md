# Structured Research — Pipeline C

Create and execute structured research campaigns. Two modes: **create** a research spec from the PM's brief, or **run** an existing spec by dispatching orchestrator agents.

**When to use this (EM pattern recognition):**
- PM asks you to research N entities with the same questions (e.g., "research all 65 teams", "compare these 12 services", "verify data for all players")
- You have a data schema and need to populate it from web sources
- You need to re-verify existing structured data against fresh sources
- The research has repeating structure across subjects — same topics, same acceptance criteria, same output shape

**When NOT to use this:**
- Exploring an unknown topic (use Pipeline A: `/deep-research`)
- Studying a codebase (use Pipeline B: `/deep-research`)
- One-off research with no repeating structure
- Quick lookups (use Context7)

**Reference:** Full pipeline design in `~/.claude/plugins/coordinator/pipelines/structured-research/PIPELINE.md`. Spec format reference in `~/.claude/plugins/coordinator/pipelines/structured-research/spec-format.md`.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` determines the mode:

### Create Mode
`/structured-research create <output-dir>`

Creates a new research spec from the PM's brief and the project's existing schema/data.

### Run Mode
`/structured-research <spec-path> [subject-key|'next'|'batch']`

Executes an existing spec by dispatching orchestrator agents. Second argument:
- A specific subject key (e.g., `FRA`) → run only that subject
- `next` → pick the next pending subject from the manifest
- `batch` → propose a batch based on batching config (default if omitted)

### Examples
- `/structured-research create tasks/journalism-research` — create a new spec
- `/structured-research tasks/journalism-research/spec.yaml FRA` — run FRA
- `/structured-research tasks/journalism-research/spec.yaml batch` — run next batch

---

## Create Mode: Build a Research Spec

When `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `create`:

### Step 1: Understand the Brief

Gather from the PM (ask if not already clear):
1. **What entities?** — Where's the list? How many? Any tiers/priority grouping?
2. **What topics per entity?** — What facets to research? (These become `topics` in the spec)
3. **What schema?** — Does a data schema already exist in the project? (Check for JSON schemas, TypeScript types, prompt files that define the output structure)
4. **What's already known?** — Is there existing data per entity? Where?
5. **What quality matters?** — Any acceptance criteria? Source language requirements? Freshness requirements?

### Step 2: Discover Project Context

Before writing the spec, read the project:
1. **Find the data schema** — look for existing type definitions, JSON schemas, or prompt files that define the output structure. This becomes the `output_schema`.
2. **Find existing data** — look for per-entity data files. The path pattern becomes `known_context.per_subject.source_file`.
3. **Find any prior research** — check for research docs, notes, or briefs that inform topic areas.

### Step 3: Write the Spec

Write to `<output-dir>/spec.yaml` using the format from `~/.claude/plugins/coordinator/pipelines/structured-research/spec-format.md`:

1. **subjects** — source file, key field, total, batching tiers
2. **topics** — 2-6 topic areas with search domains and focus questions derived from the schema gaps
3. **acceptance_criteria** — per-topic and per-subject quality requirements
4. **gates** — quality gates between phases (at minimum: official source check after Phase 1, schema conformance after Phase 2)
5. **output_schema** — key fields with types, enums, required/optional fields — derived from the project's data schema
6. **known_context** — path to existing data per entity
7. **phases** — output path templates with variable substitution
8. **manifest_path** — `<output-dir>/manifest.json`

### Step 4: PM Review

Present the spec to the PM:
- "I've written a research spec at [path]. It covers [N subjects] across [M topics]. Here's a summary: [topics list, batching plan, key gates]. Review and approve before I run it?"

Do NOT proceed to run mode until the PM approves.

## Run Mode: Dispatch Orchestrator Agents

When `$ARGUMENTS` is a spec path:

### Step 1: Read Spec and Manifest

1. **Read the spec file** at the path from `$ARGUMENTS`
2. **Read or initialize the manifest** at the spec's `manifest_path`
   - If manifest exists: compare `spec_hash` against current spec file hash
     - If hash differs: **HALT** — report spec drift to PM. Options: `continue` (keep completed subjects) or `reset` (re-run all). Do not proceed without PM decision.
   - If no manifest: initialize with all subjects as `pending`, set `spec_path` and `spec_hash`
3. **Determine subject set** based on the second argument:
   - Specific key → verify it exists, check manifest status
   - `next` → find the first `pending` or `in_progress` subject
   - `batch` (or no argument) → read batching config, identify pending subjects, propose batch to PM, wait for approval

Report: "Spec loaded. [N] subjects selected: [list]. Dispatching orchestrators."

### Step 2: Dispatch Orchestrator Agents

For each subject in the set, dispatch a `structured-research-orchestrator` agent (Opus) **in the background** (`run_in_background: true`).

Research orchestrators are long-running (15+ min per subject) and fully autonomous — the EM should not block on them. Dispatch, continue other work, and process results when notified of completion.

**Build the dispatch prompt with:**
- Spec path
- Subject key
- Existing data path (from spec's `known_context.per_subject.source_file`, with `{SUBJECT}` substituted)
- Research brief path (if a Phase 0 brief already exists from a prior partial run)
- Scratch directory: the spec's phase output paths with variables substituted
- Output path: the spec's `phase_3.output_path` with variables substituted

**Parallelism:** Dispatch multiple orchestrators in parallel if the batch has multiple subjects. Each orchestrator is fully independent — it owns its subject end-to-end. The EM does not need to mediate between them.

**Concurrency ceiling: maximum 4 orchestrators simultaneously.** Each Opus orchestrator spawns up to T parallel sub-agents per phase (where T = number of topics in the spec). A batch of N subjects × T topics can produce N×T simultaneous agents. At 4 orchestrators × 4 topics, that's 16 concurrent agents — already substantial. Beyond 4 orchestrators, the system hits rate limits, context thrashing, and cascading failures. If the batch has more than 4 subjects, dispatch in waves of 4, waiting for each wave to complete before the next.

**Subject sequencing:** The spec's `batching` config may limit how many subjects run per batch. Respect this — if the config says "3 per run", dispatch 3 orchestrators, wait for all to complete, then offer to run the next batch. The concurrency ceiling of 4 applies even if the batching config allows more.

### Step 3: Receive Results

When each orchestrator returns:
1. **Read the status** — complete or partial
2. **Read the output file** at the path the orchestrator reports
3. **Validate schema conformance** — spot-check that required fields are present and enums use allowed values
4. **Update manifest:** set subject status to `complete`, record `phases_completed: [0, 1, 2, 3]`, record output path. Set `output_applied: false`.
5. **Commit:** `git add` the manifest and all output files for this subject. Commit with message: `structured-research: {SUBJECT} complete`

### Step 4: Report to PM

After all subjects in the batch complete:

```
Structured research batch complete.
Spec: [path]
Subjects processed: [list with status]
Subjects remaining: [count pending in manifest]
Output files: [list of synthesis paths]
All output_applied: false — awaiting PM review.
```

`output_applied` stays `false` until the PM explicitly approves and applies the output.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Spec path doesn't exist | Check file exists before dispatching. Report clear error. |
| Manifest spec_hash drift | HALT and report to PM. Never silently continue on a changed spec. |
| Orchestrator returns partial | Report which phases completed and which failed. PM decides retry or skip. |
| Orchestrator returns empty output | Check output file exists and has content. Report failure to PM. |
| Mid-run crash | Manifest tracks progress per subject. Next `/structured-research` invocation resumes from where it left off. |
| Too many concurrent orchestrators | **Max 4 orchestrators at once.** Each orchestrator spawns N×topic parallel sub-agents. 68 Opus orchestrators each spawning Haiku/Sonnet agents caused catastrophic failure. Batch >4 subjects into waves of 4. |

---

## Architecture

The EM does NOT drive individual research phases. The pipeline per subject is:

```
EM dispatches → Opus Orchestrator → { Haiku scouts (parallel) → Sonnet verifiers (parallel) → Opus synthesizes } → returns deliverable
```

This design enables:
- **Parallel subjects** — dispatch up to 4 orchestrators simultaneously, wave the rest
- **EM freedom** — the EM can do other work while research runs
- **Quality judgment at the right level** — Opus evaluates gates and does synthesis, not Sonnet
