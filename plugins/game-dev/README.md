# game-dev

Game development domain plugin for the Donal + Claude agent hierarchy. Enable for Unreal Engine and game development projects.

## Components

**Agents:**
- sid-game-dev (Opus) — UE5 specialist, game systems architect, code reviewer
- ue-blueprint-inspector (Opus) — Blueprint documentation coordinator, dispatches Sonnet workers for large projects
- ue-blueprint-worker (Sonnet) — mechanical per-BP inspection via MCP, dispatched by the inspector coordinator

**Dependencies:** holodeck-docs plugin (UE documentation lookup — agent, skill, command)

**MCP Servers:** holodeck-docs (UE documentation RAG), holodeck-control (UE Editor integration) — configured globally in `~/.claude.json`

**Routing:** Registers Sid for game dev signals with Patrik (coordinator) as backstop. Simple doc lookups route to holodeck-docs plugin's ue-docs-researcher (Sonnet); architecture and review route to Sid (Opus).

## Source of Truth

The `plugin/game-dev/` directory in the [claude-unreal-holodeck](https://github.com/oduffy-delphi/claude-unreal-holodeck) repo is the canonical source for this plugin. Install scripts (`scripts/install-game-dev-plugin.{sh,ps1}`) deploy from the repo to `~/.claude/plugins/game-dev/`. Changes should flow repo → install → live, not the other way around.
