## Premise Check Contract

A premise check asks one question, over a plan's cited paths, symbols, refs, and in-repo
behaviour claims: **does this plan's premise actually hold against the tree right now?** (Its
sibling snippet, `instrument-can-report-red.md`, asks the companion question for a falsifier
itself: is its verdict wired to its exit path?)
It is written to be INLINED into a dispatch brief, never dispatched as its own agent — the
`PLUGIN_AGENTS` default-off constraint means an `agentType` the harness cannot resolve silently
degrades to a generic agent wearing the role's label, which reuses the persona and loses the
check. Whatever consumes this text must inline it directly.

**Classes 1 and 2 — paths and symbols (mechanical).** For every cited in-repo path: does it
exist? For every cited `file:line` / `file:symbol` claim: does the symbol exist in that file? This
is the same check plan-coverage-checker's Lens 3 already runs (`ls`-check cited paths,
`Read`-verify cited claims, grep backtick-quoted in-repo constants) — it is not re-derived here.

**Why `ls`/`Read`/`grep` and not the symbol-graph tools.** `project_referencers` and
`project_symbol_callers` would answer classes 1 and 2 more precisely, and they are deliberately not
used: this text is INLINED into a dispatch brief inside a workflow, and an MCP tool surface is not
guaranteed to be present for the agent that receives it — a check that silently degrades when a tool
is missing is worse than one built from primitives that are always there. The project-rag index is
also a projection that can lag the tree (1494 commits behind at the time this shipped), and a premise
check that reads a stale projection would report the tree as it was, which is the exact failure it
exists to catch. Existing checker agents ARE reused: this contract carries plan-coverage-checker's
Lens 3 calibration over verbatim rather than re-deriving it, and Lens 3 consumes this same text.

**Tolerance rule, carried over verbatim, do not recalibrate:** same-file line-number drift alone
(same file, same symbol, shifted line number) is tolerated and is NOT a finding; a missing file or
an absent symbol is a real finding.

**Class 3 — refs (mechanical, new).** A cited branch, commit or tag is checked with
`git branch -r` / `git rev-parse --verify`. A peer-repo ref MUST be cited `<repo>@<ref>` — a bare
"verified against HEAD" cannot distinguish `main` from someone's unmerged branch, and the failure
is silent in both directions. See tripwire `VERIFIED-AGAINST-HEAD-DOES-NOT-NAME-A-BRANCH`.

**Class 5 — semantics (judgment, new).** A claim that code EXISTS is not a claim it BEHAVES as
described. This class fires on either of two conditions:

1. The repo carries a surface that FORBIDS the plan's assumption — a wiki page that says so, or a
   sanctioned resolver that raises instead of defaulting.
2. Defect vocabulary (wrong, broken, fails, silently, unsafely) appears in the plan's description
   of in-repo behaviour — the cheaper, second firing condition.

On either trigger, open the cited symbol and compare its actual behaviour against the plan's claim
before trusting it — a substrate pre-flight verifies existence, not described behaviour, so a
claim that code EXISTS is never treated as a claim it BEHAVES as described. Where NEITHER surface
fires, class 5 degrades to reviewer judgment and the verdict must say so plainly rather than
guessing — this asymmetry is why the pass reports and does not refuse.

**Class 5 is PROVISIONAL.** Classes 1-3 generalize from a measured corpus; class 5's second firing
condition (defect vocabulary) generalizes from ONE incident (2026-07-27: a plan claimed a model
resolver's default was defective when it was in fact a PM-ratified asymmetry, caught only because
a defect-vocabulary trigger like this one would have flagged it for a symbol read). That is
enough to ship it as an acceptance criterion and not enough to call the trigger calibrated. The
mark comes off once a later session has counted enough real firings, in
`state/audits/2026-09-06-blitz-conversion-re-measurement.md`'s Arm C table, to say the trigger's
precision — each row sourced from a wave's per-baton `*.premise-check.md` sidecar under that
wave's trail directory (`sidecarFor(trailDir, batonId, 'premise-check')` in `plan-blitz.mjs`).
Until a wave has actually run this check, that table is empty and the PROVISIONAL mark stands —
an empty table is not evidence the trigger is miscalibrated, only that it has not fired yet. Until
the mark comes off, a class-5 finding carries the same weight as any other finding — only the
TRIGGER is under review, not the finding's validity.

**Mechanical vs. judgment split, carried over verbatim.** Classes 1, 2 and 3 are mechanical:
existence either holds or does not. Class 5 is judgment: it requires reading a symbol's actual
behaviour and comparing it to a claim. A verdict that mixes the two without labeling which is
which loses the distinction that lets a reader gauge rework altitude at a glance.

**Reporting, never refusing.** State plainly, in every verdict, which class(es) were checked and
what was found — name the check in words (path, symbol, ref, semantic, instrument), never a bare
class number: a number alone reads as more precise than the taxonomy underneath it actually is.
**A premise check never claims plan correctness.** It catches a class of false premise; a plan
whose every citation resolves against the tree can still be wrong. This pass reports what it
checked and what it found; it does not ratify the plan, and it does not refuse to report a partial
or degraded result — a semantic-check miss with no forbidding surface and no defect vocabulary is
reported as "semantic check not applicable, degrades to reviewer judgment," not withheld.
