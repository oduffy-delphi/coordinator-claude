"""cc_invoke — Python-side transport for coordinator_core.invoke.

Port of: coordinator-core-invoke.sh (DoE c6d97219, 2026-07-22) — the bash transport's
fail-closed timeout/nonzero-exit/empty-stdout ladder and DEC-1..3 op-timeout budget
logic are mirrored here deliberately; several comments below note specific behavioral
parity points the port preserved.

Purpose: spawns `sys.executable -m coordinator_core.invoke <op> <params_json> --repo <repo_root>`
with a timeout cap; applies a fail-closed timeout/nonzero-exit/empty-stdout ladder,
then parses the
{jsonrpc,id,result} envelope that is coordinator_core.invoke's default (non---bare)
response shape (see DR-215 ref below). On the route() path, the engine root is resolved ONCE via the native
_resolve_claude_klabauter_root ladder (env var → pointer file → coordinator_core.engine_root,
no bash subprocess anywhere) — forwarded to cc_invoke() via _claude_klabauter_root for both the
find_spec gate and the subprocess env (single resolution source).

Public API:
    resolve_colocated_claude_klabauter_root(script_file) -> str
        Self-location-first engine-root resolution for a CLI that lives INSIDE the
        engine checkout (coordinator/bin/*.py). Tries Path(script_file)'s
        parents[2] first (probed against coordinator_core/ + pyproject.toml markers);
        falls back to _resolve_claude_klabauter_root()'s machine-local registry ladder only
        when that probe misses (the published/vendored-outside-the-checkout case).

    cc_invoke(op, params, repo_root) -> dict
        Returns the bare result dict on success (jsonrpc/id/result wrapper stripped).
        Raises RuntimeError on ANY transport failure (timeout / ImportError / empty stdout /
        bad envelope / op-error envelope) — except a structural contract-pin failure
        (engine rc=2), which raises the distinct StructuralPinError subclass instead.
        NEVER returns legacy after a native attempt. Uses the non-bare envelope-parse
        call convention (params via --params-file, ARG_MAX-immune — see cc_invoke's
        own docstring's Params transport note; NOT positional argv).

    cc_invoke_bare(op, params, repo_root) -> dict
        The shared Python promotion of the retired bash cc_invoke (see module Port of
        note): the --bare
        fail-closed ladder + the DEC-1..3 per-op timeout-budget logic, moved OUT of the
        shell transport so downstream facades can `from cc_invoke import cc_invoke_bare`
        instead of each inlining a local mirror of the shell --bare ladder (the campaign
        anti-goal). Spawns coordinator_core.invoke with --bare (engine emits the bare
        result object directly) and --params-file (ARG_MAX-immune on Windows/msys), with a
        per-op timeout ceiling resolved once-per-process from the engine's op-budget dump.
        Shares the timeout/nonzero-exit/empty-stdout fail-closed rungs with cc_invoke() via
        _raise_on_process_failure — one ladder, two call conventions. Returns the bare
        result dict; raises RuntimeError on any transport failure, or StructuralPinError
        (a RuntimeError subclass) specifically on a structural contract-pin failure
        (engine rc=2).

    route(op, params, repo_root, legacy_fn)
        State-1 seam-absent (find_spec("coordinator_core.invoke") returns None with the engine
        root on sys.path) → call and return legacy_fn(). No native spawn attempted.
        State-2 seam-present → cc_invoke(op, params, repo_root); propagate result or exception.
        Transport failure on the native path → raise (HARD error, never fall to legacy_fn).

    route_mutation(op, params, repo_root, legacy_fn)
        Mutation-aware sibling of route(): calls route(), then raises RouteMutationError
        if the returned dict carries a non-zero 'exit_code', a non-empty 'failed' list, or
        a non-empty string 'error' with exit_code absent/0 — the engine repo's op-level refusals
        live INSIDE the result payload with no top-level 'error' key at the ENVELOPE level,
        so bare route() would return them unraised. Python sibling of the shell transport's
        strangle_route_mutation (Port of: strangler-facade.sh, DoE c6d97219, 2026-07-22).

Spec backlink: DoE-claude:pln-strang-08-arm-the-doe-queue-fa-36567b § C1
DR-215 ref: coordinator_core/invoke/__main__.py's default (non---bare) response IS the
            {jsonrpc,id,result} envelope this module's cc_invoke() parses (--bare is
            opt-in server-side) — the envelope-parse convention is verified against the
            real engine's default response shape, not just this module's own fake test
            harness. The retired bash cc_invoke (Port of note, top of module) was the
            byte-oracle for the --bare/--params-file ladder mirrored by cc_invoke_bare(),
            not for this non-bare envelope-parse function.

Negative-spec (retired transport patterns — DO NOT reintroduce):
    - The coordinator_core client-module seam is retired (DR-215); this module does NOT
      import or use it.
    - Unix domain sockets are retired (DR-215); this module does NOT open one.
    - IPC authentication tokens are retired (DR-215); this module does NOT read one.
    - This is a TWO-STATE router (seam-present / seam-absent); there is no daemon-aware
      third state IN THIS ROUTER, and none should be added here. DR-315 (2026-08-15)
      authorizes a demand-driven warm engine process on the seam-present side of this
      same two-state split — that is a property of what coordinator_core.invoke's own
      process does once seam-present dispatch reaches it (a client-side pipe-first,
      spawn-on-FileNotFoundError decision inside the engine's own entry paths), not a
      third state this router discriminates on. route()'s State-1/State-2 shape is
      unchanged by DR-315 and stays two states.
    - find_spec is an INTENTIONAL improvement over the retired shell facade's full-import
      probe; do NOT replace it with an execute-import to "match" the old bash behavior.

    THE POINT IS THE DISCRIMINATION, NOT THE NAME. `-32004` is the one refusal
    that says nothing about whether the write landed, and the client cannot
    narrow it: `warm/client.py :: _try_warm_dispatch_inner` sets `delivered`
    immediately after `flush()`, and that function's own zero-byte branch
    concedes what flush proves — "the bytes left THIS process into the pipe
    buffer -- it never proved the server read them". There is no acknowledgement
    between the kernel pipe buffer and the server's dispatch, so delivered-then-
    stalled and died-mid-flight are indistinguishable at that layer BY
    CONSTRUCTION. Nothing downstream can recover the answer from the envelope.

    What a caller CAN do is reconcile against the artifact the op would have
    written, if it knows the path — which is why this is a distinct type rather
    than another `RuntimeError`. A caller that owns a deterministic target path
    (`cross-repo-memo draft` computes `state/memo-outbox/<topic>.md` from argv,
    before dispatch) catches this by name and stats it, turning "may or may not
    have landed" into a definite answer. A caller that does not know its target
    path keeps the existing `except RuntimeError` behaviour unchanged.

    Negative-spec: catching this is NOT licence to retry or to re-run the op
    cold. Re-executing a delivered mutation is the double-execution the refusal
    exists to prevent (`state/bug-backlog/2026-08-19-scoped-git-commit-still-

    (its version guard, malformed TOML) — see `cmd_get`'s own docstring. Under a

    failure the same way it does today.

    Returns `None` on ANY failure — the caller treats that as "ask the
    subprocess", never as "the key is absent".

    Negative-spec: does NOT re-implement the resolution ladder, the TOML layer
    stack, or the sibling-repo scan; it calls the impl's own `resolve_one`.
    Does NOT replace `_machine_local_get` — that function keeps the

    The ladder every ``coordinator/bin`` entrypoint should use to find the
    engine it is about to import from:

      Rung 1: ``COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT`` in the environment, when it names a
              real directory — the explicit operator/test-harness override.
              (Pre-C14 this rung read ``CLAUDE_KLABAUTER_ROOT``; the dual-read window
              closed and the old name is no longer consulted here — see
              ``_ENGINE_ROOT_NEW_VAR``/``_ENGINE_ROOT_OLD_VAR``'s module-level
              note.)
      Rung 2: self-location — ``_walk_up_to_checkout(script_file)``, the
              nearest enclosing checkout at any depth.
      Rung 3: ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root()``'s remaining rungs — the
              ``<settings-home>/machine-local/.claude-klabauter-root`` pointer file, then
              the machine-local ``repos.claude_klabauter`` registry key.

    Distinct from ``resolve_colocated_claude_klabauter_root`` in rung ORDER, and the
    difference is load-bearing: that function probes self-location BEFORE the
    environment, so a caller pointing a script at a different engine checkout
    via ``COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT`` is silently served the one the script
    happens to sit in. Its existing callers are pinned to that ordering, so
    this is a new function rather than a change of semantics underneath them.

    Relative to the bare ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root()`` this replaces at ~26 call
    sites, rung 1 is NOT byte-identical. Both still consult
    ``COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT`` first and both still let it outrank every
    other rung — but unlike ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root``, which returns any
    non-empty env value verbatim, this rung 1 is gated on
    ``os.path.isdir(env_root)``: a set-but-nonexistent
    ``COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT`` (e.g. stale after a cross-platform sync —
    ``~/.claude`` is shared between machines whose absolute paths differ, so a
    value baked on one box can name nothing on the other) falls through to
    self-location instead of being honored. This is deliberate: silently
    trusting a nonexistent root would reintroduce the ModuleNotFoundError this
    function exists to remove. The consequence for a caller relying on the old
    verbatim-return behavior — e.g. a test harness that deliberately pins a
    broken ``COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT`` to assert on the resulting failure — is
    that it will no longer get that broken root back; it gets self-location's
    answer (or the registry ladder's) instead.

    Otherwise: self-location is consulted ahead of the pointer file and the
    registry. That is what makes a script inside an engine checkout work on an
    install whose machine-local registry was never populated, which is the
    portability defect this exists to close: before it, a hand-set
    ``PYTHONPATH`` was the only remaining answer.

    Note the one behavior change that follows: on a box whose pointer file or
    registry names a DIFFERENT checkout than the one the script lives in, the
    script now uses its own. That is the intended reading of "co-located" and
    matches what ``resolve_colocated_claude_klabauter_root``'s callers already do; an
    operator who genuinely wants the other tree sets
    ``COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT`` to an EXISTING directory, which still outranks
    everything.

    Raises RuntimeError (via ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root``'s fail-loud remediation
    text) when every rung misses.

    A caller that must fail loud when the engine is unresolvable belongs on
    THIS function, not on ``ensure_engine_on_path`` — see that function's
    docstring for why the degrading form is the wrong choice there.

    `pm_resolution.warn_sink` for the counter-not-stderr shape and why).

    A fallible step that degrades, never raises — NOT the thin, non-fallible
    wrap this docstring once claimed to be. The sink call touches the
    filesystem under `state/`, and every wrapper and `_seam_present` in this
    module discards this function's return value, so the whole body — the
    query call, the sink call, and the `ProvenanceReport` construction — sits
    inside one outer `except Exception` that degrades to an
    `unresolved`-verdict `ProvenanceReport` rather than letting a filesystem
    edge case propagate past a caller that must never raise on any input or
    filesystem state (hard constraint 3). `provenance_against`'s own
    no-raise/no-import/no-sys.path-mutation guarantees still hold unchanged
    for the query half; this function's own body deliberately never touches
    `sys.path` either — the sink lookup is a plain ambient import, retried
    nowhere, so an environment where `coordinator_core` is not importable
    degrades the same way any other failure here does.

    The sink import is ambient-only (no `sys.path` mutation of any kind,
    matching this function's own no-`sys.path`-reference guard test) — a
    process where `coordinator_core.engine_provenance_counter` is not already
    importable simply does not get a recorded count, same as any other
    degrade-to-`unresolved` case below.

    THE `unimported` EARLY RETURN IS HARD CONSTRAINT 2, NOT AN OPTIMIZATION.
    The sink lives under `coordinator_core`, so importing it binds the very
    package this seam exists to observe. Reporting it unconditionally would
    make asking the question create its own answer: a wrapper front-inserts
    its root, the sink import then binds `coordinator_core` from that root,
    and every later call in the process measures a binding the detector
    itself caused. Worse, hooks on the blocking `UserPromptSubmit` path call
    these wrappers, and a consumer that had not imported the engine must get
    `unimported` — never an import as a side effect of the question. So an
    `unimported` verdict returns BEFORE the sink import, which also keeps
    that hot path free of both filesystem work and a package import (AC9).
    Nothing is lost by not counting it: `provenance_against` returns
    `unimported` exactly when `sys.modules` has no `coordinator_core`, so
    the three verdicts that can carry a divergence — `match`, `divergent`,
    `unresolved` — are all still recorded, and they are the only ones C7's
    inventory can say anything about.

    FOOTGUN FOR TEST AUTHORS (Review: code-reviewer P2): the `except
    Exception` below also catches `AssertionError` (a subclass of `Exception`
    in Python), not just filesystem/import failures — hard constraint 3
    forces the broad catch, so this is not fixable without weakening it. A
    test that injects a raising double INSIDE this function's body to assert
    something failed loudly will have that assertion silently swallowed
    instead of propagating; probe `sys.modules`/return values directly, the
    way this file's own AC2/AC9 tests do, never a raise from inside a
    monkeypatched probe.

    """Where the ALREADY-IMPORTED ``coordinator_core`` actually came from,

    ``root`` is keyword-only on purpose: a call site written as
    ``provenance_against(_resolve_claude_klabauter_root())`` at a locator-axis wrapper
    must read as wrong (missing the required keyword) rather than silently
    type-checking with the wrong root bound positionally.

    Why this is not redundant with `_front_insert_on_path`. Front-inserting a
    resolved root onto `sys.path` is the correct guard and it wins in a clean
    process, but it is defeated by the module cache: once ANYTHING in the
    process has done a bare `import coordinator_core`, `sys.modules` is bound
    and every later insert is a no-op. On a box with an editable install
    (`site-packages/__editable__.coordinator_core-*.pth` naming a working
    tree) that ambient path is on `sys.path` from site init, so the losing
    case is the default rather than the exception. The insert asserts an
    intent; this asserts the outcome — against whatever root the CALLER
    considers authoritative, not a root re-derived here.

    Negative spec -- what this deliberately does NOT do:

    - It does NOT import `coordinator_core`. A consumer that has not
      imported the engine gets `PROVENANCE_UNIMPORTED`, never an import as a
      side effect of asking a question.
    - It does NOT resolve `root` itself, and does NOT fall back to any
      locator when `root` is falsy -- callers own resolution; this function
      only compares. A falsy `root` degrades to `PROVENANCE_UNRESOLVED`,
      same as an import whose `__file__` is unreadable.
    - It does NOT raise, on any input or any filesystem state. A single
      outer `except Exception` degrades every fallible step to
      `PROVENANCE_UNRESOLVED` rather than letting a filesystem edge case
      escape past a caller's fail-open contract.
    - It does NOT mutate `sys.path` to repair a divergence, here or anywhere
      else in this function.

    The failure this exists to make visible is silent, not loud: both trees
    export the same names, so a consumer reading the wrong one differs only
    in behaviour or timing that will not reproduce elsewhere -- and can
    still pass every budget and assertion it is checked against.

    This divergence is ORDINARY and this function does not treat it as a
    defect: `require_dispatch_engine_on_path`'s own docstring records that on a
    conformant box with both env vars unset the two ladders return different
    roots by design -- dispatch reaches the published mirror, the locator axis
    reaches the live working tree. Nothing here refuses, retries, or repoints.

    It exists because the SILENCE is expensive in one specific way. When the
    mirror lags, a fix committed to the live tree is inert through every
    `coordinator/bin` CLI, and the failure that produces is indistinguishable
    from the fix being wrong. Worse, the obvious diagnostic confirms the wrong
    answer: the CLI-root resolvers all report the live working tree, truthfully,
    about the CLI -- so an operator asking "which tree am I running" is told the
    one that is not deciding. Measured cost, 2026-08-28: `/handoff` stayed
    broken through this seam after its repair had landed, three runs, and two
    sessions read it as a bad fix before anyone looked at which `apply.py` was
    actually loaded.

    Negative-spec: not a warning, not a gate, never raised -- the
    `ProvenanceDivergenceError` below is a DIFFERENT divergence (coordinator_core
    already bound from somewhere else, which IS a defect). Emitted at most once
    per process, and never when the two roots agree, so a single-tree box sees
    nothing. Any failure to emit is swallowed: a broken stderr must not take a
    dispatch down.

    Approximation (Review: code-reviewer nit, slice a6725136cee84332c): the
    locator half of the comparison resolves `resolve_engine_root(__file__)`
    against THIS module's own location (`cc_invoke.py`), not the invoking
    CLI script's -- always the same checkout today since this module is
    co-located under `coordinator/bin/lib/` in every checkout that imports
    it, but a future vendor/symlink split of `cc_invoke.py` away from

    The collapse target for the inline bootstrap preamble that ~200 CLIs under
    ``coordinator/bin`` carry verbatim::

        claude_klabauter_root = _resolve_claude_klabauter_root()
        if claude_klabauter_root not in sys.path:
            sys.path.insert(0, claude_klabauter_root)

    NOTE THE MISSING PARAMETER, because it is the whole point. Every other
    ``*_on_path`` wrapper in this module takes ``script_file`` and resolves on the
    LOCATOR axis — "where is the source checkout", answered by walking up from the
    calling file. This one takes nothing, because the DISPATCH answer — "which
    engine executes" — is a property of the box, not of the caller's location. A
    signature that cannot accept a script path cannot silently be handed one.

    WHY NOT REUSE ``require_engine_on_path``. It is the same shape one axis over
    and adopting it here looks like the obvious collapse, but on a conformant box
    with both env vars unset the two ladders return DIFFERENT ROOTS:
    ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root()`` reaches the published mirror through the
    pointer-file/registry rung, while ``resolve_engine_root()`` reaches the live
    working tree through its self-location rung. Routing the inline copies onto the
    locator seam therefore repoints every one of them from the published engine to
    the working tree — a fleet-wide behaviour change wearing a collapse commit's
    label. Measured and reverted once already; see the plan's delivery notes.

    So this is a SECOND seam on a DIFFERENT axis, not a duplicate of the first. The
    duplication C16 forbids is two seams answering the same question.

    Catches NOTHING, matching the inline body it replaces: a ``RuntimeError`` from
    ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root()`` (every rung missed) propagates to the caller, whose
    own ``except RuntimeError`` remediation path is usually the reason it is there.

    Returns the resolved dispatch root, so a caller that also needs to hand it to
    ``cc_invoke`` can end on ``root = require_dispatch_engine_on_path()``.

    HARDENED (C9, docs/plans/2026-08-26-the-seam-reports-what-it-got.md § C9):
    raises RuntimeError when the reporting call resolves a ``divergent``
    verdict — an earlier module-level import (of ``repo_identity``,
    ``records_query``, ``machine_local_resolve``, or
    ``coordinator_core.win_portability``) already bound ``coordinator_core``
    into ``sys.modules`` off a tree other than this call's own resolved
    ``root``, so the ``sys.path`` front-insert above is a no-op and the
    caller is silently running the wrong tree. Landable only because C8
    (docs/research/engine-provenance-carrier-dependence.md) enumerated every
    carrier this defect shape was confirmed to reach and read each one's
    touched surface as behaviourally identical between trees — this raise is
    what turns a future carrier's genuinely-divergent surface into a loud
    failure instead of a silent wrong-tree run. Explicitly NOT applied to
    ``ensure_engine_on_path`` (see that function's own docstring for why its
    degrade-to-None contract must stay intact for the engine-less scaffold
    case) and not applied to the locator-axis wrappers above, which this
    chunk's evidence does not cover.

    A ``match``, ``unimported``, or ``unresolved`` verdict is unaffected —
    this only raises on the one verdict that means "running the wrong tree".

    SOURCE-TWIN CARVE-OUT (pytest-under-source-checkout case). A ``divergent``
    verdict does not by itself mean a THIRD, unrelated tree — it is also the
    verdict for the one EXPECTED pair this function's own docstring above
    already documents: an already-bound ``coordinator_core`` from the SOURCE
    checkout (e.g. bound by a repo-root ``conftest.py`` importing
    ``coordinator_core.ops`` during ``pytest_load_initial_conftests``,
    strictly before any test module runs) against a dispatch ``root`` that
    correctly resolves to the PUBLISHED MIRROR of that same source checkout.
    Both trees are legitimate; the comparison inside ``provenance_against``
    just cannot tell "known mirror twin" from "unrelated third tree" on its
    own, because it only compares paths, never checkout identity.
    ``_is_source_twin`` closes exactly that gap: it resolves the LOCATOR axis
    for THIS file (``resolve_engine_root(__file__)`` — the existing
    self-location ladder, not a new resolver) and asks whether the
    already-bound module's ``__file__`` sits under that locator root. When it
    does, the two roots are the source-checkout/published-mirror pair by
    construction, and this returns normally instead of raising.

    Spec: docs/plans/2026-08-20-an-engine-root-is-not-named-for-the-repo.md § C18.
    Axis definition: docs/decisions/DR-326.

    `COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT` in the child env carries the DISPATCH answer -- which engine
    executes -- because that is what `_resolve_claude_klabauter_root()` returns and what
    this process is about to run. A grandchild asking the LOCATOR question
    ("where is the source checkout?") reads the same variable and is handed a
    published mirror. Two facts, one variable.

    NEGATIVE SPEC -- ADDITIVE ONLY. This returns ONLY the locator key. It never
    touches `CLAUDE_KLABAUTER_ROOT`, `COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT`, or `PYTHONPATH`, so the
    dispatch variable's meaning and value are byte-identical to before this
    landed and a child that ignores the new key behaves exactly as it does
    today. That property is what makes a semantic split landable across four
    version-skewed parties (live tree, published mirror, deployed settings home,
    sibling repos) -- it turns "four parties x two meanings" into "four parties
    x two variables".

    Resolves through `_machine_local_get`, NOT through `_resolve_claude_klabauter_root()`:
    the registry's `repos.claude_klabauter` IS the locator answer, whereas the
    ladder deliberately prefers the published engine. Returns `{}` when the key
    is unset or the lookup fails -- a box with no registered checkout must keep
    spawning children exactly as it does now, so this is best-effort by design
    and never raises into the spawn path.

    In-process first (`_machine_local_get_in_process`), subprocess only on its
    miss. This function runs on EVERY `cc_invoke()` and `cc_invoke_bare()`, so
    the subprocess it used to take unconditionally was a per-invocation,
    fleet-wide process spawn for one unchanging key. The value is byte-identical
    on both paths -- `resolve_one` is the accessor the spawned `cmd_get` itself
    calls -- so the additive-only property above is unchanged.

    ``coordinator_core.invoke`` splits its two failure channels by ORIGIN, not by
    severity, and the split is easy to misread as "errors go to stderr":

      - A PRE-dispatch failure (bad args, unresolvable repo_root) goes through
        ``_fatal_stderr``, which writes its JSON-RPC error envelope to **stderr**
        and exits 1.
      - A dispatch that COMPLETED with an op-level error is an ordinary JSON-RPC
        response: ``main()`` prints it to **stdout** and exits 1 via
        ``_exit_code_for_response``. Stderr is typically empty.

    ``_raise_on_process_failure`` only ever read stderr, so the entire second
    class — every op-level refusal, every exception escaping a handler, an
    unknown method — reached the operator as a bare
    ``invoke process exited 1 (op=X) — op or dispatch error`` followed by an
    empty ``stderr:`` line, with the reason nowhere: it was sitting on stdout,
    discarded unread. That is how ``ceremony.wsc_tail`` failed on doe-claude-em's
    Windows box with no recoverable diagnosis
    (``cross-repo/inbox/2026-08-07-doe-claude-em-windows-ceremony-cli-coordinator-core-import-break.md``),
    and why that one item's symptom looked unlike its two siblings' — those died
    in the trampoline process itself and printed a real traceback, while this one
    died behind the transport's blind side.

    Returns an indented ``  op error: ...`` line for a JSON-RPC error envelope, a
    capped ``  op stdout: ...`` line for anything else non-empty, or ``""`` when
    stdout carries nothing. Never raises — this runs on a path that is already
    failing and must not acquire a second failure mode of its own.

    To reproduce the stdout-borne error envelope this recovers, without firing a

    single additive constant covering the client-side cold start the engine's budget
    excludes; falls back to `_NO_BUDGET_FALLBACK_SECS` when the op-budget dump is absent
    or errored (with a once-per-process breadcrumb on error).

    NOTHING IN THE ENVIRONMENT REACHES THIS NUMBER, and that is the point. Both terms
    used to be env knobs — a FLOOR (`CC_INVOKE_TIMEOUT_SECS`) and a MARGIN
    (`CC_INVOKE_CLIENT_MARGIN_SECS`), each unbounded above, each read through a generic
    positive-int reader. A caller in a sibling repo ran a single op with the floor set to
    460 and got a 460s client wait on a shared box; the margin was defended by nothing at
    all. The client's wait now tracks the engine's declared budget and cannot be widened
    from outside the engine.

    Negative-spec (DO NOT reintroduce): no `os.environ` read may re-enter this function
    or `_timeout_exceeded_message`. A narrowing read is not the exception it looks like —
    the same variable that narrows also widens the moment a later edit swaps `min` for
    `max`, which is exactly how the retired FLOOR grew. An op that needs a wider wait
    needs a wider ENGINE budget, declared server-side where a ratchet can see it.

    Ceremony ops need no special case HERE and deliberately do not get one: their 2s
    engine budget arrives through the ordinary `--dump-op-timeouts` read (the engine
    projects every `ceremony.*` op explicitly for exactly this reason), so the formula
    yields 2 + 2 = 4 without knowing anything about ceremonies. The margin still applies
    because it bounds the CLIENT's wait -- cold python startup is the client's problem,
    not the engine's budget -- and collapsing the client wait onto the engine budget
    would kill legitimate cold dispatches. What ceremony ops do get is a different REMEDY

    EVERY miss (warm disabled, no pipe, busy, someone else's pipe, a stale
    ENGINE_SKEW server, read-deadline expiry, `coordinator_core` not
    importable at all, ...) or when warmth is disabled outright.

    Never raises — but note WHY, because the reasoning was wrong once and
    the wrongness was invisible. `try_warm_dispatch` never raising covers
    the DISPATCH CALL; it says nothing about the three `coordinator_core`
    imports that precede it, and those are what a bare interpreter with no
    engine on its import graph actually hits. Three /workday-start health
    probes hard-crashed on exactly that
    (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'coordinator_core'`) while every
    other engine CLI in the same ceremony ran fine. Each import site is now
    guarded and degrades to the cold spawn.

    Mirrors `coordinator_core/invoke/__main__.py :: _dispatch_argv_body`'s
    own steps 6/6a — that function is the oracle for this shape; read it at
    source rather than trusting this docstring's paraphrase to stay in sync.

    Step 1 (cost gate, before ANY `warm.client` import): `coordinator_core.
    warm.settings.is_warm_enabled` imports only `machine_resolver.
    registry_get`. `warm.client` unconditionally imports `warm.election` +
    `warm.settings` at ITS OWN module level (29.2ms measured tax,
    __main__.py's own step 6a comment) regardless of whether warmth is on —
    so this function checks `is_warm_enabled()` first and returns
    immediately on a False, before `warm.client` is ever imported.

    Step 2: `WORKTREE_SCOPED_OPS` comes from `coordinator_core.op_scopes`,
    NOT `coordinator_core.ipc` — `ipc.py`'s own re-export block documents
    why: `ipc.py` does `import asyncio` at top level plus
    `coordinator_core.lifecycle`, `session.declared_writes`, `locked_write`
    and more, dragged into every op's import path if imported here;
    `op_scopes.py` imports only types/typing. `_should_pass_repo` two
    functions away already does this correctly (`from coordinator_core.
    op_scopes import WORKTREE_SCOPED_OPS`); this mirrors that same import.

    Step 3: builds the JSON-RPC 2.0 request envelope — jsonrpc/id/method/
    params, `_origin_worktree` set to the caller-supplied `repo_root` when
    `op` is worktree-scoped (central/none-scoped ops silently omit it, same
    as `__main__.py`), and `_caller_cwd` set unconditionally (telemetry-only,
    never read for authz/repo-scope resolution — see `__main__.py`'s own
    comment on that field).

    Step 4: imports `try_warm_dispatch` from `coordinator_core.warm.client`
    and returns its result directly — `try_warm_dispatch` itself never
    raises (module docstring). That inheritance covers the call and NOT the

    accepts `--params-file` independently of `--bare` — no positional
    `params_json` argv is ever passed by this function anymore, so mode
    selection (file vs. argv) is unambiguous: the child only ever sees
    `--params-file <path>` for this call convention.

    Args:
        _claude_klabauter_root: already-resolved engine root (forwarded by route() to avoid a
            second resolution on the State-2 path). If None, resolved here via
            _resolve_claude_klabauter_root(). Keyword-only; callers outside route() should omit it.
        _stderr_sink: when provided, the child's captured stderr text is appended to
            this list on the SUCCESS return path (rung 4) if non-empty — lets a caller
            recover diagnostic text a well-formed op-level refusal envelope wrote to
            stderr (e.g. `_setup_error()`'s reason), which would otherwise be discarded
            once rc==0 and stdout parses cleanly. Never consulted on the raise paths
            above (those already fold stderr_text into their own message). Keyword-only;
            most callers omit it.

    Raises:

        strip. cc_invoke() uses the non-bare envelope-parse convention.
      - `--params-file`: params ride a temp file, not argv — ARG_MAX-immune on
        Windows/msys, where a ~50KB+ payload overflows a bare argv arg (exit 126 HALT).

        _CLIENT_START_MARGIN_SECS for every op, resolved once-per-process from the
        engine's --dump-op-timeouts map; _NO_BUDGET_FALLBACK_SECS when that surface is

    """route_mutation refusal — carries the full offending result payload.

    The raised message alone only carries exit_code and a failed *count*; a
    caller catching this exception (or a human reading a traceback) has no way
    to recover the actual failed-item detail or error text without re-deriving
    it from logs. `.result` gives structured access to the full dict route()
    returned, mirroring the shell oracle's STDOUT PASSTHROUGH contract
    (the retired bash strangler facade's STDOUT PASSTHROUGH contract) where the full captured JSON is always
    re-emitted alongside the refusal.

    `.op_stderr` (default "") carries the child invoke process's captured stderr text,
    when any — this is where a well-formed-but-refusing op (e.g. `_setup_error()`)
    writes its own diagnostic sentence, which a bare exit_code/failed[] inspection of
    `.result` never sees. Folded into the raised message too, so a bare `str(exc)` is
    self-diagnosing without the caller needing to reach for `.op_stderr` explicitly.

) -> Any:
    """Mutation-aware sibling of route() — honors the engine repo's in-envelope exit_code/failed/error.

    Purpose: route() returns the BARE result dict on transport success, but the engine repo's
    op-level refusals (build_setup_error_result -> {"exit_code": 1, ...}; build_act_result
    with partial/total failure -> {"exit_code": 2, "failed": [...]}) live INSIDE that
    result payload with no top-level 'error' key — cc_invoke's envelope ladder only
    raises on transport failure, so a bare route() call returns these refusals UNRAISED.
    route_mutation is the Python sibling of the shell transport's
    strangle_route_mutation() (see module Port of note): after a successful
    route(), it inspects the result for exit_code/failed/error and raises
    RouteMutationError so mutation callers (e.g. cross-repo-memo send) fail loud on an
    op-level refusal instead of proceeding as if the write succeeded. Closes the DR-215
    exit_code trap.

    Two distinct native refusal shapes are caught, mirroring strangle_route_mutation's
    documented two-shape contract:
      (1) {"exit_code": N, ...} with N != 0 — the handoff/memo _err shape.
      (2) {"error": "..."} with exit_code absent or 0 — the completion_ops/plan_ops
          shape (coordinator_core/ops/completion_ops.py, plan ops). This is DISTINCT
          from the top-level JSON-RPC error envelope cc_invoke() already raises on
          (cc_invoke.py's "error" in envelope check operates on the OUTER envelope,
          mutually exclusive with a "result" key being present) — shape (2) here is an
          "error" key nested INSIDE a present "result" payload, which cc_invoke's
          envelope ladder does not see and returns as an ordinary bare result. Without
          this branch, shape (2) would be a silent phantom success.
      The `failed`-list check (not present in the shell oracle) is this helper's own
      addition for build_act_result partial-failure shapes.

    State-1/State-2 gating and transport-fail-raises behavior are inherited unchanged
    from route() — this function only adds a post-hoc inspection of a successful result.

    Raises:
        RouteMutationError (a RuntimeError subclass with a `.result` attribute holding
            the full offending payload): if the result is a dict with a non-None,
            non-zero 'exit_code'; a truthy 'failed'; or a non-empty string 'error' with
            exit_code absent/0. `.op_stderr` carries the child invoke process's own
            stderr text when the refusing op wrote a diagnostic there (e.g.
            `_setup_error()`), and is folded into the raised message too — a well-
            formed refusal envelope's `failed[]` can be empty (nothing per-item to
            report) while stderr still names exactly what went wrong.
