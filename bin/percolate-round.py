"""percolate-round.py — one-command sequencer for a single-target percolate
publish round: dry-run -> parse -> scan-secrets -> inverse-drift -> Step 3
gate -> real run -> commit -> CI smoke -> push (on a clean round; DR-301).
`--no-publish` stops before the push, same as this module's old behaviour.

Ports the nine hand-driven steps `coordinator/skills/percolate/SKILL.md`
(DoE-claude) currently has the EM drive one CLI invocation at a time into a
single sequenced driver. Every step already has its own CLI
(`percolate-gate.py`, `percolate-parse-dryrun.py`, `publish.py`) — this
module SEQUENCES those via subprocess, it does not reimplement any of their
logic. The commit step is the one exception: `scoped-git-commit` (the
`ceremony.scoped_git_commit` CLI) was killed 2026-08-23 (PM ruling, DR-344),
so the commit leg calls `coordinator_core.git.commit.commit_paths` in-process
instead (C3, docs/plans/2026-08-29-the-push-subsystem-leaves-and-then-the-
pipeline-can-go.md -- repointed off the killed `commit_pipeline.
run_commit_pipeline`, which itself mirrored `publish.py::
_commit_published_dests`, 2026-08-25).
Single-target only: multi-target (no-argument) round orchestration is
explicitly out of scope (see the originating plan's Out of scope section).

THE LOAD-BEARING CONSTRAINT IS RELAXED BY DR-301, NOT BY A LATER READER'S
INFERENCE (docs/decisions/DR-301-agent-initiated-publish-push-is-automatable.md):
this CLI now DOES invoke `git push` — on a clean round, publishing is the
default, not an operator's separate step. What replaced the old never-push
constraint is the EVIDENCE GATE (`_round_refusal_reason`, C2/AC3): the push
runs only when every row succeeded, `declined_paths` is empty, no
unacknowledged Phase 4 REVIEW warnings remain, and CI smoke (run AFTER the
commit — see below) came back green. `--no-publish` opts back into the old
print-and-stop behaviour, and `_print_push_notice` survives as exactly that
path (plus the gate-refused path, where it names the condition
`_round_refusal_reason` reported) — it prints `percolate-push <target>`
(coordinator/bin/percolate-push.py) rather than running anything, in both
of those cases. A future reader restoring "never push" as a "fix" would be
reverting DR-301, not correcting a bug.

The self-disarm half of the old constraint is UNCHANGED and stays true:
this CLI still never creates or clears an `allow-xrepo-write` marker.
`bump_foreign_repo_write` denying an unauthorized push into a publish
mirror is the guard working as designed; a CLI that clears its own marker
is the self-disarm shape the guard pack blocks elsewhere, and DR-301 does
not license it (DR-301 § Negative-spec). The round-failure marker this
module DOES write/clear (`setup/percolate-state/<target>.round-failed.json`,
see `_round_failure_marker_path` below) is a different marker, under a
different name, gating a different thing — it can only make
`percolate-push.py`'s own destination-state gate (C4) refuse harder; its
absence never grants a push that gate would otherwise refuse. It never
touches the `allow-xrepo-write` namespace.

Commit-pathspec provenance (AC7, superseded 2026-08-23 by chunk C4 of
docs/plans/2026-08-23-rebuild-the-percolate-round-as-six-steps.md AC4/AC5,
and again 2026-08-26 by chunk C2 of docs/plans/2026-08-26-a-refused-round-
strands-its-payload-forever.md AC2/AC2b): the pathspec passed to the commit
leg (`coordinator_core.git.commit.commit_paths`, repointed C3 2026-08-29 off
the § C6 2026-08-25 `commit_pipeline.run_commit_pipeline`) is derived from
a `RoundManifest` (`coordinator_core.percolate.manifest`) publish.py's real
run persists to disk (`_read_fresh_round_manifest`), never from a re-parse of
that run's printed `NEW:`/`UPDATE:`/`DELETE:`/`REMOVE:` lines, and never from
a `git status` survey of the destination either. `_pathspec_from_manifest`
compares the manifest's `declared_payload` set against dest HEAD, not
against dest's working tree -- the worktree baseline is what let a stranded,
already-synced-but-uncommitted round compare byte-equal forever and hid a
still-uncommitted deletion outright, since Step 4's real run had already
removed the file from disk before the next round's comparison ever ran (see
that plan's "The root cause, stated exactly"). A rename needs no
source-to-target resolution under this shape: it naturally reports as a
REMOVE (old name, tracked at HEAD, absent from the declared payload) plus a
NEW (new name, in the declared payload, absent from or differing at HEAD) --
a correct end state for the commit regardless of whether git's own
similarity detector later recognises it as a rename (docs/plans/2026-08-13-
the-publish-round-commits-the-names-it-a.md § C2, AC2, whose pathspec-names-
only-post-transform-paths invariant this still satisfies, just via a
different mechanism). Every entry is a specific file path — never a
directory — so the pathspec the commit leg receives never contains a
directory element, satisfying `commit_pipeline.explicit_stage`'s
untracked-files-beneath-a-directory-never-swept behaviour by construction,
without needing to touch that module (see the originating
plan's Substrate corrections § 1-2 for why touching it would be wrong).

CI-smoke ordering (the other subtlety the plan calls out): CI smoke
(`_run_ci_smoke`) runs AFTER the commit, never before. A file the real run
de-allowlisted out of the destination stays TRACKED at the destination's
pre-commit HEAD until that deletion is committed — `check-python-checks`
false-reds on it until then. Running CI smoke pre-commit reproduces that
false red; this module's step order rules it out.

Usage:
    percolate-round.py <target> [--percolate-root <path>] [--yes] [--no-publish]

  <target>            Single registered percolate target name (resolved via
                       `setup/publish-targets.portable`). Required.
  --percolate-root     Override the resolved PERCOLATE_ROOT (SKILL.md Step
                       0.5). Defaults to `percolate-gate.py resolve-root`'s
                       own four-rung ladder. Exists mainly so a test or a
                       repo-local percolate-root clone can pin the root
                       without env-var plumbing.
  --yes                Skip the interactive Step 3 confirmation prompt and
                       proceed as though the operator answered "y". The
                       gate-fire DETECTION logic still runs unconditionally
                       (deletions / >=10 files / sensitive paths / MEDIUM
                       leak hits / inverse-drift hits are still computed and
                       still printed) — this flag only removes the blocking
                       `input()` call, for scripted/CI invocation. It never
                       touches the push step: `--yes` cannot make this tool
                       push, only skip the human=y/N read on the publish
                       gate.
  --invocation-authorized
                       Treat THIS invocation itself as the Step 3 confirm.
                       For a skill/slash-command wrapper only: the human
                       already supplied authorization by invoking the
                       command, and the wrapper passes this flag to say so
                       — it must never be set by a bare human CLI run or by
                       an unattended/cron/nested-agent caller, since it
                       skips the prompt unconditionally the same as --yes
                       (distinct flag because --yes is forbidden on an
                       interactive PM session by the invoking skill's own
                       rules, and conflating the two would collapse that
                       distinction). A tty invocation without this flag
                       still prompts; a non-tty invocation without it
                       exits _EXIT_CONFIRM_REQUIRED instead of prompting.
  --no-publish         Opt out of the default publish-on-clean-round
                       behaviour (DR-301). Keeps the old print-and-stop
                       terminus: `_print_push_notice` prints the
                       `percolate-push <target>` command instead of running
                       it, even on an otherwise-clean round.

Exit codes:
    0 — PASS or PASS-WITH-WARNINGS on a clean round: pushed (unless
        `--no-publish`, in which case the push command was printed
        instead). Also 0 for a no-op round (nothing to publish) whether or
        not it found unpushed dest commits to push (AC2b).
    1 — FAIL: some step exited non-zero, or the operator declined the Step 3
        gate, or CI smoke came back red, or a green round's push itself
        failed. No push command is printed on a FAIL that reaches past the
        commit (AC8/AC4) — printing it after CI has already told the
        operator not to push would contradict the FAIL this function
        itself just reported.
    2 — usage error (bad argv, target not resolvable via Branch 0 gate).
    3 — Step 3 confirm required: the round reached the publish gate on a
        non-tty stdin without `--invocation-authorized`. Fires for ANY
        non-tty stdin, `sys.stdin.isatty()` being false is the entire test —
        including a piped answer (`echo y | percolate-round.py ...`) that
        would have supplied one; this driver never calls `input()` off a
        tty, on purpose, so a piped answer is refused rather than read.
        Named refusal, not a crash — the round's dry-run verdict prints
        first, nothing is published. Use `--invocation-authorized` or
        `--yes` for the scripted/non-interactive path.

Negative-spec: does NOT create or touch `setup/percolate-state/<target>
.lastsync` or any `allow-xrepo-write` marker (it DOES read/write/clear its
own, differently-named round-failure marker — see module docstring above),
does NOT edit `coordinator_core/git/commit.py` or `percolate-gate.py` (both
owned elsewhere — the commit leg below is a CALLER of
`coordinator_core.git.commit.commit_paths`, not an editor of it), does NOT drive
Branch 0's interactive first-run setup walk (a target that fails the branch0-gate
check here is a usage error pointing back at `/percolate <target>` to walk
setup, not something this CLI attempts itself), and does NOT support
multi-target/no-argument rounds.

#: D1 fix — inherited-holder handoff. `_cmd_round` opens `_round_held_lock`
#: over `Path(dest)` and spawns `publish.py` (Step 4 real run) as a
#: subprocess INSIDE that `with` block; `publish.py::main`'s own lock loop
#: (`_publish_held_lock`, keyed identically via `held_lock`'s
#: `sha1(realpath(target))`) then tries to acquire that SAME key from a
#: fresh `os.open` in the child process, which blocks against the parent's
#: still-open flock (flock is per-open-file-description, so it blocks
#: across the process boundary too) until `LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS` and the round
#: dies. This env var, set ONLY on the Step 4 real-run child's own env (never
#: on any other subprocess this driver spawns, and never left in
#: `os.environ` afterward), carries the `os.pathsep`-joined list of
#: `"<this process's own pid>=<realpath>"` entries this parent process
#: already holds `_round_held_lock` over. `publish.py::main`'s lock loop
#: skips acquiring exactly those roots, only once it has verified the
#: entry's PID against its own `os.getppid()` (§ code-reviewer P2 —
#: presence alone is not authentication), and still acquires every other
#: root the run's rows resolve to — never a blanket "skip all locking when
#: this token is present." `_INHERITED_LOCK_ROOTS_ENV` itself now lives in
#: `percolate.wire_contract` (shared with `publish.py`, single source of

#: ---------------------------------------------------------------------

#: ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#: THE UNIT MISMATCH THIS BLOCK EXISTS TO HANDLE, stated first because
#: every constant below is built out of it and a later reader will
#: otherwise "simplify" it back out.
#:
#: DR-344 gates on PROCESS TIME. `subprocess.run(timeout=)` can only ever
#: enforce WALL CLOCK. On this box those differ by two orders of
#: magnitude, and not because anything is slow — because 50-70 concurrent
#: sessions is the design condition, so a spawn waits to be scheduled.
#: Measured 2026-08-21, plain `subprocess.run`, 60 samples each:
#:
#:   leg                            process   wall p50   wall p95   wall max
#:   `git --version`                 33.6ms    1,462ms    2,891ms    4,588ms
#:   `git -C dest rev-parse`         33.6ms      847ms    2,907ms    4,065ms
#:   `git -C dest status --porcelain` 190.6ms     791ms    2,524ms    2,841ms
#:   `python -c pass`                36.7ms      411ms      905ms    1,644ms
#:
#: So a leg costing 34ms of CPU routinely takes 1.5 wall-seconds to
#: complete, and took 4.6 at worst. A `timeout=2.0` on local git — the
#: value `coordinator_core/git/repo_root.py :: _TIMEOUT_SECS` ships and
#: the hitlist prescribes — is therefore a coin flip HERE, where the
#: bound is a hard kill of a live publish round rather than a degrade to
#: a parent-walk. It was tried: `test_percolate_round_dest_paths_exist ::
#: test_mixed_batch_with_worktree_fast_path_and_git_probe_combined` went
#: red under a concurrent suite and green in isolation, which is the
#: definition of a bound firing on peer load instead of on cost.
#:
#: The resolution is ADDITIVE, never multiplicative: the scheduling delay
#: is a roughly fixed per-spawn cost of sharing the box, not a factor
#: that scales with the leg. So each bound below is
#: `<what this leg may cost> + <what the box adds to any spawn>`, and the
#: second term is ONE named constant. That keeps the load norm visible as
#: its own term instead of dissolved into a house number, and it means
#: raising it for one leg raises it for all of them (DR-349 § 2).
#: ---------------------------------------------------------------------

#: What the box adds to any spawn under its design load, over and above
#: the leg's own cost. 2.2x the worst wall-clock spawn-to-exit observed
#: across the 170 samples above (4,588ms, for a 33.6ms `git --version`).
#: It is headroom over a measured maximum, not a budget: nothing is
#: allowed to COST this, and a leg that consumes it is either wedged or
#: the box has gone twice past its worst observed scheduling delay —
#: both reportable, neither a reason to raise this.
_SPAWN_SCHEDULING_HEADROOM_SECS = 10.0

#: Local git: the nine sites that spawn `git` against `dest` and wait for
#: one answer, plus the two batched whole-pathspec index reads.
#: Measured process time per spawn at dest — `rev-parse --show-toplevel`
#: 24.2ms, `rev-parse HEAD` 24.2ms, `status --porcelain` 190.6ms (the

#: `ls-files --error-unmatch` over 400 paths 37.5ms, `check-ignore -z
#: --stdin` over 400 paths 212.5ms, `clean -fdn` 40.6ms.
#: The cost term is 2.0 — CLAUDE.md § Load norm's absolute per-process

#: (`LOCAL_PLUMBING_BUDGET_SECS = 2.0` + its own
#: `_SPAWN_SCHEDULING_HEADROOM_SECS = 10.0`, converted in one place by
#: `_wall_bound`), so the two now agree on both axes and this constant is
#: numerically identical to what `run_git(args)` resolves to.
#:
#: The remaining gap is shape, not bounds: `run_git` returns a
#: `GitResult` where every call site here consumes a `CompletedProcess`,
#: and takes args WITHOUT a leading `"git"`. All nine legs can migrate —
#: including `_dest_gitignored_paths`' `check-ignore -z --stdin`, once
#: that seam grew a bytes-only `input=` whose binary mode keeps the text
#: wrapper off the pipe (the `-z` scar below is written into its
#: docstring as the reason). Deferred deliberately: a shape-only sweep
#: across nine sites is its own reviewable unit, and folding it in here
#: would cost a reviewer the ability to see either change clearly.
#:
#: Negative spec: this bounds a PATHSPEC-scale input, not a tree-scale
#: one. `check-ignore -z --stdin` measured 4,553ms of process time when
#: fed all 102,024 dest paths, so a round whose pathspec approached tree
#: scale would breach — that is a defect report about
#: `_dest_gitignored_paths`' unbounded input, never a licence to raise
#: either term.
_GIT_PLUMBING_TIMEOUT_SECS = 2.0 + _SPAWN_SCHEDULING_HEADROOM_SECS

#: The one genuinely remote leg (`_push_dest`'s `git push`). Named
#: separately because a network round trip has a cost model no local
#: measurement bounds; DR-349 grants network legs no standing carve-out,
#: so this is a runaway guard, not a budget — the scheduling term is
#: immaterial against it and is deliberately not added. A read-only round
#: trip to the same remote (`git ls-remote --exit-code origin HEAD`)
#: measured 62.5ms of process time over 4 spawns and 1,347ms of wall, so
#: 120 is ~89x the observed trip; the margin is for a push's upload, not
#: for the handshake. Takes the tree's existing named push bound
#: (`coordinator_core/hooks/auto_push.py :: GIT_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS`) so the
#: two push sites agree instead of differing by 5x. A reduction from the
#: inherited 600, never a raise.
#:
#: It does NOT yet take `coordinator_core.git.run`'s remote lane
#: (`run_git(..., remote=True)` → `REMOTE_BUDGET_SECS` 30.0 + headroom =
#: 40.0s wall), and the reason is that the difference is a real decision
#: rather than a rename: 40 vs 120 is a 3x cut on the one leg here that
#: uploads a whole publish round's objects over a network, and no
#: measurement of a real push exists on either side. That seam documents
#: migrations onto it as needing to surface as decisions; this is one.
#: Measure a real push before adopting it.
_GIT_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS = 120.0

#: Registry/target resolution: `machine-local get`, `percolate-gate.py`'s
#: `resolve-root` / `branch0-gate` / `list-targets`, and
#: `coordinator-state-root.py --central`. Each is one interpreter start
#: plus a small config read. Measured process time — `percolate-gate.py`
#: 67.2ms, `coordinator-state-root.py --central` 50.0ms, against a
#: `python -c pass` floor of 36.7ms. Same 2.0 cost term as the git
#: family: these resolve identity, and identity resolution that COSTS
#: seconds is the defect, not the bound.
_REGISTRY_CLI_TIMEOUT_SECS = 2.0 + _SPAWN_SCHEDULING_HEADROOM_SECS

# NOT dead, despite this module's own legs no longer passing it: the scan and
# parse legs here became in-process `_run_step` calls, but `percolate-mirror.py`
# loads THIS module as `_round` and still spawns `percolate-parse-dryrun.py`
# through `_round._run(..., timeout=_round._ROUND_SCAN_LEG_TIMEOUT_SECS)` at
# three sites, and `test_percolate_round.py :: _DECLARED_LEG_BOUNDS` names it.
# Deleting it as unreferenced-in-this-file breaks the mirror driver at runtime.
_ROUND_SCAN_LEG_TIMEOUT_SECS = 60.0

#: The round's own scan legs: `percolate-parse-dryrun.py` (x2 per branch)
#: over the publish leg's stdout, and `percolate-gate.py`'s `scan-secrets`
#: and `inverse-drift` over the round's scan-file-list.
#: Measured on the registered `claude-klabauter-bin` row (2,064-file scan
#: list): `parse-dryrun` 96.9ms of process time over 1 spawn;
#: `scan-secrets` 307.3ms over 1 spawn; `inverse-drift` 880.2ms over
#: **25 spawns**, 4,569ms wall. 60.0 is 13x that worst member's wall.
#:
#: Sized above the additive shape the two families above use, and the
#: reason is the spawn count: `inverse-drift` pays the scheduling delay 25
#: times, not once, so a single headroom term does not cover it. That is
#: the honest bound for the code as it stands, and it blesses nothing —
#: both underlying numbers are defect reports owed upward. 880ms of
#: process time is over DR-344's 500ms brightline, and 25 spawns for one
#: gate leg is the amplification shape
#: `coordinator_core/tests/test_no_unbatched_per_item_git_spawn.py`
#: exists to catch. This constant comes down when they are fixed.
#:
#: All four call sites that once passed this as `timeout=` to a spawned
#: `_run` moved to in-process `_run_step`, which takes no timeout -- the
#: derivation above is preserved as the provenance record for
#: `percolate-gate.py`'s `_GIT_LEG_TIMEOUT_SECS` (60s, same figure), which
#: cites this number by value, not by name.

#: The commit leg used to be a `scoped-git-commit` subprocess with its own
#: timeout, split OUT of the publish bound below (staging/committing is a
#: different cost model from re-walking the whole source tree). Re-pointed
#: 2026-08-25 (§ C6) at `commit_pipeline.run_commit_pipeline` in-process —
#: no subprocess, no timeout of its own; the constant that named it
#: (`_COMMIT_LEG_TIMEOUT_SECS`, was 300.0) is retired along with it.

#: The three `publish.py` call sites — `_cmd_round_default`'s real run,
#: and `_cmd_round`'s dry run plus its real run — of which any one round
#: fires at most two. Each walks the whole source tree, applies the rename
#: transform into a fresh staging root, and runs the per-row guard set
#: over it.
#:
#: HELD at 3600, on a measurement rather than on the "slow, not hung, the
#: box is busy" sentence this docstring used to carry (DR-344 § 7 retired
#: that sentence). One `publish.py --dry-run --no-delta` of the SINGLE
#: `claude-klabauter-bin` row measured **88,750ms of process time across
#: 211 spawns**, 139s wall. `percolate-mirror` publishes all nine of that
#: mirror's rows through ONE `publish.py` invocation, so the measured
#: single-row cost extrapolates past 1,200s — which is why the reduction
#: to 900 this rebuild first attempted was withdrawn: it would have
#: hard-killed every mirror publish. Lowering it is a scope call reserved
#: to the PM (DR-349 § "What this record does not decide").
#:
#: So this number is not defended here, it is REPORTED. 88.75s of CPU and
#: 211 process creations to dry-run one row is the defect the 3600 marks,
#: exactly as the hitlist's framing predicts, and no value of this
#: constant is a fix for it. The hitlist's own answer stands: the bound
#: has nothing left to justify it once that spawn count comes down.

    A round used to spawn eight Python interpreters: five `percolate-gate.py`,
    two `percolate-parse-dryrun.py`, one `publish.py`. That is an artifact of
    this module's own origin -- it ports nine steps the EM used to type one CLI
    invocation at a time, and the subprocess boundary came along with them
    rather than being required by any of them. Measured with
    `coordinator_core/benchmarks/process_time.py :: batched_process_time_ms`
    (k=6): `percolate-gate.py resolve-root`, which does almost nothing, costs
    39.1ms process / 104.2ms wall against a 15.6ms bare-interpreter floor.

    Both sibling CLIs are shaped for this: `main(argv)` is three lines over
    `args.func(args)`, every `_cmd_*` handler RETURNS an int, and the only
    `sys.exit` in either file is its `__main__` guard. `SystemExit` is caught
    anyway -- a handler is free to grow one, and the round must not die of a
    step's exit the way it would not have died of a child's.

    Returns a `CompletedProcess` rather than a bare int so every call site
    keeps its existing `returncode`/`stdout`/`stderr` handling verbatim,
    including `_print_step_failure`, which prints the argv. `args[0]` is
    therefore the equivalent spawn, not a real one: it is what a reader would
    run by hand to reproduce the step.

    WHAT STAYS SPAWNED, and why it is not an oversight: `publish.py` (§ the
    real run). It is the only leg whose `_run` bound guards actual work rather
    than spawn scheduling (`_PUBLISH_LEG_TIMEOUT_SECS`, 3600s), it needs a
    distinct child environment (`_INHERITED_LOCK_ROOTS_ENV`), and one
    interpreter for the round's real work is proportionate where eight for its
    bookkeeping was not. An in-process call cannot be timed out -- there is no
    killable unit -- so a leg whose bound is load-bearing keeps its process.
    That is also why `percolate-gate.py`'s two `git` calls grew their own
    `timeout=` in the same change: collapsing `inverse-drift` in here would
    otherwise have removed the only bound they had.

    This function itself carries no timeout of any kind -- verified true for
    the two sibling CLIs as they stand today (no other blocking call, no
    unbounded loop, no network I/O), but that is an inspection of the
    current bodies, not a property this function enforces. The old
    subprocess boundary was a backstop regardless of what the child did;
    this one is not. A future change adding a blocking call (another
    `subprocess.run`, a network fetch, an unbounded read) to either sibling
    CLI must bring its own bound the way `_GIT_LEG_TIMEOUT_SECS` does,
    because the round driver no longer supplies one.

    THE LOAD-BEARING FRESHNESS CHECK that makes deleting the destination-
    dirtiness gate safe (AC5): `not_before` is a `time.time()` timestamp
    captured by the caller immediately before spawning the real-run
    subprocess. If the manifest file's mtime predates it, this is a LEFTOVER
    from an earlier round -- either a crashed predecessor that wrote a
    manifest but never got to commit it, or (the ordinary case) a prior
    successful round whose manifest THIS round's real run had nothing to
    overwrite because THIS round was a genuine no-op. Either way, treating a
    stale file as this round's own bytes is exactly the "can't distinguish
    this round's bytes from a crashed predecessor's" defect the dirtiness
    gate used to guard against by inspecting `dest` BEFORE the real run ever
    started; this check inspects the manifest's OWN provenance AFTER the
    real run finishes, which is the more direct question to ask.

    Absence at this point can ONLY mean a genuine no-op, never an
    undetermined row: this function's caller only reaches it after
    confirming the real run exited 0 with no per-row failure text, and
    publish.py's own `main()` folds every succeeded row's changed/removed
    sets (sourced from `_report_published_diff`, which is unconditionally
    determined once reached, never `None`) into its end-of-run accumulators
    before deciding whether to write a manifest at all -- it skips the write
    ONLY when the accumulated added/updated and removed sets are BOTH empty

    whose changed-set publish.py itself could not determine, would have made

WHAT OPENED IT, in the order the objections fell. Each was a real gate, and
none was waved through -- the history is here because a reader deciding
whether to trust this flag needs to know which arguments were answered by
evidence and which dissolved.

  Both operands mis-scoped   -> fixed (C1). `row_scope` from
                                `manifest.published_dest_dirs` bounds width;
                                `declared_payload` widened past the scan

  Could delete a live file   -> `_refuse_removals_present_on_disk`, a hard
                                refusal, doe-claude-em's condition of assent.
  Per-mirror assent needed   -> DISSOLVED, not satisfied. klabauter is ours
                                (PM); both owners can assent, so the
                                per-target scoping this flag lacks is
                                unnecessary. See the space-vs-time note below.
  Numbers off stale walks    -> a round on the fixed walk ran at each mirror.
  A crash could fake it      -> `publish.py :: _refuse_stranded_root_swap_
                                prior`. The root-dest swap's window was the
                                one mechanism that manufactures this leg's
                                exact preconditions; it is guarded at the
                                source rather than predicated around here.

MEASURED before the flip, both manifests postdating `e6ca74a70` (the walk fix):

  coordinator-claude   66 candidates, 0 present on disk, all 66 verified by
                       hand as absent from DoE source (tracked or untracked),
                       so none is re-publishable payload.
  claude-klabauter     0 candidates. declared 4673 / head 4670 / 0
                       `.fleet-env`.

klabauter read 0 BEFORE the walk fix too, and that 0 was the opposite of this
one: `declared_payload` had swamped the tree (48,929 declared, 44,264 of them
`.fleet-env`), emptying the removal set while the round reported a clean pass.
Same digit, opposite meaning. Never read a 0 here as "no backlog" without
checking the manifest's provenance first.

THE STANDING RISK, said out loud rather than left to be discovered:
`_refuse_removals_present_on_disk` is DORMANT at coordinator-claude, because 0
of the 66 are present on disk. The safety of that set therefore rests on the
by-hand source verification above, not on the guard. The guard protects the
NEXT round, not this one.

Two notes worth carrying to the next question on this module:

  - A property someone proposes to scope by SPACE (per-mirror, per-target,
    per-path), where the scoping does not bite, is usually one that varies
    over TIME. Every safety question here had that shape (DoE-claude
    coordinator/docs/wiki/verification-discipline.md, tripwire
    A-SAFETY-PROPERTY-HOLDS-OVER-AN-INTERVAL-NOT-OVER-A-THING).
  - An in-process predicate cannot close a cross-process hole. Two attempts
    were made here -- a round-clean predicate and a pre-sync probe -- and both
    failed for that reason. What works is a durable witness written BEFORE the
    window opens.

Leg A (`manifest.removed`, ungated, below) is not retired by this. The two
legs cover disjoint cases: Leg A carries a removal the CURRENT round observed;
only this leg can clear a backlog, which is by construction invisible to
`_report_published_diff`."""


def _pending_removal_warning(dest: str) -> str:
    """The revert instruction this module prints on its two decline paths is
    NOT the neutral undo its own architecture comment claims (§ `_cmd_round`,

    -fd`-revertible, so a decline here leaves a synced-but-uncommitted `dest`,
    never a lost push"). Returns text to append to that instruction, or "".

    The premise held while the dest worktree carried nothing but the current
    round's bytes. It stopped holding the moment stranded removals began
    accumulating there -- which is the condition this whole deliverable exists
    because of. A path deleted from dest's worktree and still tracked at dest
    HEAD exists NOWHERE else: publish.py's `_report_published_diff` compares
    staging against that same worktree, so once a path is absent from it the
    removal is unobservable and never re-reported. The worktree IS the only
    record. `reset --hard && git clean -fd` restores every one of them and
    walks the mirror back to a state both removal legs have to re-earn --
    silently, and by following this module's own documented remedy.

    Measured 2026-08-26 at the `coordinator-claude` mirror: 66 such paths (43
    stranded from an earlier pass, 23 from a hand sweep). A HIGH-tier leak
    refusal there would have cost the entire backlog with no signal that it
    had.

    Named, never blocked. The revert is still the right move for an operator
    who wants the round undone; what was missing is that it is not free. Reads
    `git status --porcelain=v1` and counts a `D` in EITHER the staged or the
    worktree column (`line[0] == "D"` or `line[1] == "D"`) -- both leave a
    deleted-and-tracked-at-HEAD path whose only record is dest's worktree, the
    hazard this probe exists to catch. An unstaged deletion (`" D"`) is the
    ordinary case; a staged one (`"D "`) is left behind by a prior invocation
    of THIS module's own commit leg (`commit_pipeline.explicit_stage`'s
    `git add -- <paths>`) that died between staging and committing. A
    rename-with-delete (`"R  old -> new"`) is correctly excluded by this
    predicate: the destination content still exists under the new name, so
    there is no lost record for this warning to raise. `=v1` pins the format
    explicitly rather than relying on it staying git's untagged default.
    Fails toward saying nothing on a probe failure -- an unreadable dest must
    not manufacture a warning about a count it does not have.

    opened against a mirror this repo does not own.

    Why this exists on top of AC2. AC2 fixes the CAUSE of the known
    false-positive class: `declared_payload` sourced from the percolation SCAN
    surface misses a published-but-never-scanned file, which then reads as
    "no row declares this". Two members are known --
    `.github/scripts/check-persona-names.py` (both mirrors; deliberately
    excluded from the transform sweep so the release-CI checker never scrubs
    itself) and `coordinator_core/warm/door/door.exe` (a binary in a declared
    directory). A measured `live-undeclared == 0` is a snapshot of that class
    at one moment; the next member is a file nobody has written yet. AC2 fixes
    the cause, this catches the recurrence.

    LOUD, NEVER SILENT. A candidate that survives `(head_tree ∩ row_scope) -
    declared_payload` and is STILL on disk means the operands are wrong again
    -- that is a defect report, not a path to quietly drop from the set. A
    silent-skip version would have hidden both known witnesses rather than
    surfacing them, which is how the mis-scope stays invisible until it
    deletes something that mattered.

    with this invariant in place the pre-flight dry run is a CHECK, not a

    `lexists`, NOT `exists`. `exists` follows symlinks, so a TRACKED symlink
    whose target is missing reads as absent, passes this refusal untouched,
    and is deleted by the removal side -- the one file class where "not on
    disk" is a statement about the target rather than about the path itself.
    Zero tracked symlinks on either mirror today; this is what keeps the first
    one from being reaped silently on the round that introduces it.

    destination file opens with `#!`. Returns how many paths were named.

    WHY THE FILESYSTEM BIT IS NOT ENOUGH, which is the whole defect this
    closes. `publish_sync._restore_shebang_executable_bit` chmods the copied
    file on disk, and that is the module's only exec-bit mechanism. Both the
    source and the mirror run `core.fileMode=false`, so git ignores the
    filesystem bit entirely and the file lands `100644` however the source is
    recorded. The bit therefore reached mirrors only from hosts where
    `core.fileMode` happens to be true -- accidentally correct on macOS,
    silently wrong on Windows, and visible only when a NEW executable is
    published from the wrong host. Reported by doe-claude-em 2026-08-26 after
    three rounds self-blocked: the round committed locally and then failed its
    own mirror CI `check-exec-bit`, whose remediation ("run `git update-index
    --chmod=+x` in source and commit") was both already satisfied at source and
    unreachable at the mirror, since the publish-mirror guard correctly denies
    a direct write there. Nothing on the side the failure named could fix it.

    ONE PROCESS, BATCHED, NEVER PER FILE -- `git add --chmod=+x -- <paths>` in
    a single call for the whole set (the amplification gate at
    `coordinator_core/tests/test_no_unbatched_per_item_git_spawn.py` governs
    this loop). `add` rather than `update-index` because a newly published file
    is not in the index yet and `update-index --chmod` requires an existing
    entry; `add --chmod=+x` stages and sets the mode in the same operation. The
    commit leg's own `git add` that follows preserves the recorded 100755,
    because with `core.fileMode=false` git reuses the index mode rather than
    re-reading it off disk -- which is the same property that makes the
    on-disk chmod inert.

    FAILURE IS NOT A ROUND FAILURE, AND THAT COVERS RAISING, NOT ONLY A
    DECLINE. A path git refuses here (gitignored at dest, most likely) leaves
    the round exactly where it stands today, at `100644`, so this can only
    improve on the status quo and must never be the thing that fails a publish.
    The whole body is wrapped for the same reason: this step sits BETWEEN the
    pathspec derivation and the commit, so an exception escaping it leaves the
    dest synced with paths staged-but-uncommitted — a strictly worse failure
    class than the refusals around it, which all leave a state the next round
    simply re-derives. It raised exactly once, on 2026-08-26, when
    `_cmd_round_default` passed `_resolve_repo_root`'s `str` into a `Path /`
    expression and took a live round down at the commit leg (doe-claude-em).
    A best-effort mode fix has no business ending a publish.

    `repo_root` therefore takes `str` or `Path`: `_resolve_repo_root` returns
    `Optional[str]`, and coercing here rather than at the call site keeps a
    future caller from re-introducing the same crash.

    `declined_paths` being empty, so these otherwise-benign declines used to
    block the publish from ever pushing itself):

    - gitignored paths at dest (`.gitignore`-excluded content, e.g.
      `__pycache__/*.pyc`, must never be published — naming them is a
      derivation bug, not a legitimate change to land).
    - deletion-intents (`DELETE`/`REMOVE` tag) for a path that does not
      exist at dest in the worktree OR the index — the desired end state
      (absent) already holds, so there is nothing to commit.
    - anything beneath a publish-STAGING directory (§
      `surface.PUBLISH_STAGING_DIR_RE`, the same SSOT every walk prunes on).
      A staging directory is scratch a crashed round left behind; it is not
      payload any row declares. This filter is not hypothetical — 1,028 files
      of `coordinator/.bin.publish-staging-dsnce3r6.prior` reached the public
      mirror through this exact pathspec in round `eebf1c67`, because nothing
      between the change-line report and the commit knew what a staging
      directory was. They carried no identity findings (a `.prior` is a
      post-swap backup of already-transformed bytes), so this closes a
      cruft-in-the-payload hole, not a leak.

      Matched on DIRECTORY segments only, never the basename: a file named
      `x-publish-staging-y.py` is real payload, the same distinction
      `store.py` and `engine.run_parse_sweep` draw.

    Deliberately narrow: does NOT filter anything else. A path that
    genuinely should land and does not is the real failure mode here — an
    uncertain case is left in, so a real decline still surfaces via the
    commit leg's own report (`_declined_paths_from_stage`) rather than
    being silently swallowed here.

    Preserves AC7 provenance: filtering happens on the pathspec already
    derived from the real run's own reported change lines, never adding or
    substituting a `git status` survey.

    RETURNS `(kept, drops)`, never the bare list. `drops` is the per-class
    count of what this function removed, and it is returned rather than only
    printed because an empty `kept` is otherwise indistinguishable from a row
    that declared nothing: the caller's no-op branch read a filtered-to-empty
    pathspec and printed "real run reported no changed files", a statement
    about the ROW made on evidence about the FILTER. Same ruling as
    `_round_warnings` — a stderr line above a green verdict is not a report
    (DoE-claude memo 2026-08-26, percolate-round-passes-but-drops-every-
    removal); the count has to reach the verdict block.

    NEGATIVE SPEC — `drops` is not an error channel. Every class it counts is
    a legitimate drop (`git check-ignore` is index-aware, so an ignored path
    here is one `git add` would refuse without `-f`; a deletion-intent whose
    target is already absent has nothing to express; staging scratch is not
    payload). It exists so the round can NAME what it dropped, never so it
    can refuse on it.
