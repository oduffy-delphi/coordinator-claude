coordinator-doc-new — scaffold a conformant coordinator document (handoff, spinoff, memo, plan, decision, audit-record, completion, sidecar, run-report [alias: flight-recorder], research-synthesis, review-findings) or delegate to a typed writer for queue/lesson/workflow types.
# Review: code-reviewer slice-B F7 — module docstring updated to list all supported types.

Spec backlink: docs/plans/2026-06-25-example-initiative-tc-0-canonical-baton-shape.md § C4 (D3)
Spec backlink (A4): docs/plans/2026-06-25-example-initiative-tc-4-fleet-machinery-contract-emit.md § A4
Spec backlink (C3b): pln-fleet-deliverable-spine-identity-and-facets-2b331c § D1, D2, D3, C3b

Purpose: Emit conformant frontmatter + the canonical section skeleton for a baton
artifact, writing it to a file. The EM fills the body via Edit. This is the GENERATE
altitude of the schema registry — the third altitude that kills frontmatter drift at
the source by making the schema the production template, not just the validation rule.

Supported types:
  handoff            — session continuation baton (kind: session-handoff)
                       handoff_phase: continuation is scaffolded unconditionally;
                       execution_authorized_* fields are deliberately NOT scaffolded
                       (stamped only at execution-authorization time — see
                       docs/plans/2026-07-17-execution-handoff-phase-doe-contract.md § C4)
  recovery           — crash-recovery baton (kind: recovery); predecessor is a crashed
                       commit SHA or null (NOT a predecessor handoff path);
                       recovers_session names the crashed session id
  spinoff            — workstream-fork baton (kind: spinoff)
  roadmap-baton      — roadmap stub baton (kind: roadmap-baton)  requires --roadmap-id --stub-id
                       BACKWARD-COMPAT ALIAS: --type spinoff-roadmap (same emitter, same
                       output shape) — the flag now agrees with the kind it scaffolds.
  goal-seed          — goal-scoped fork baton (kind: goal-seed), no predecessor baton
                       BACKWARD-COMPAT ALIAS: --type spinoff-goal
  roadmap-seed       — roadmap-stub-producing fork baton (kind: roadmap-seed), no predecessor baton
                       BACKWARD-COMPAT ALIAS: --type spinoff-roadmap-creator
  memo               — cross-repo memo LOCAL skeleton (not delivered; send via cross-repo-memo)
  plan               — plan document (docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md)
                       REQUIRES an explicit sizing answer: --sizing-object PATH, or
                       --no-sizing-object to declare the plan genuinely has none
  decision           — architecture decision record (docs/decisions/DR-NNN-<slug>.md,
                       DR number allocated + collision-checked; optional --dr-prefix)
  audit-record       — architecture audit record (docs/architecture/audit-records/YYYY-MM-DD-<system>.md)  requires --system <name>
  completion         — workstream completion log entry (archive/completed/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md)  optional --nature, --chain
  goal               — goal artifact with OKR frontmatter (state/goals/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.yaml)
  sizing-object      — fleet routing-lobby sizing record (state/sizings/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.yaml)
  health-status      — daily health summary record (state/health/YYYY-MM-DD-health-summary.md)
  strategic-self-description — per-repo strategic self-description, whole-document-YAML
                       (state/strategic/self-description.yaml); one-per-repo, not date/slug-derived
  review             — review sidecar (docs/plans/<stem>.review.md)  requires --plan <stem>
  prior-art-check    — prior-art-check sidecar               requires --plan <stem>
  plan-coverage-check — plan-coverage-check sidecar          requires --plan <stem>
  docs-check         — docs-check sidecar                    requires --plan <stem>
  run-report         — universal subagent run-report sidecar requires --plan <path> --chunk <id> --out <path>
                       --out is REQUIRED (no default path); the live output location is
                       .coordinator-local/subagent-share/<session-id>/<key>.md, path owned and computed
                       by claude-klabauter's provision_report engine at spawn time
                       (superset schema — subsumes flight-recorder; DEC-3, plan
                       2026-07-13-subagent-run-report-subsume.md § C4)
  flight-recorder    — BACKWARD-COMPAT ALIAS for --type run-report (same emitter,
                       same output path/shape). Kept so in-flight callers do not break.
  research-synthesis — deep-research synthesis record (docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md)
                       frontmatter index over a PROTECTED expressive prose body (HEADERS ONLY in scaffold)
  review-findings    — code-reviewer self-persist findings sidecar  requires --slice <id> --scope <comma-paths>
                       outputs to .coordinator-local/subagent-share/<session-id>/YYYY-MM-DD-codereview-slice<ID>-<SLUG>.md
                       (the DR-091 home -- same session-scoped root provision_report uses; SLUG is
                       sanitized from --scope; the <!-- FINDINGS --> sentinel is the Edit anchor)
  subagent-sidecar   — agent-side decision-object container (schemas/decision-object.schema.json
                       subagent_sidecar schema definition) requires --plan, --chunk and --out
                       --out is REQUIRED (no default); the LIVE sidecar path is computed by
                       coordinator_core.subagent_sandbox.provision_report at spawn time, reached
                       from coordinator_core.hooks.cater_subagent_start on SubagentStart, under
                       .coordinator-local/subagent-share/<session-id>/<key>.md. This CLI branch is the
                       manual/test scaffold path only. Carries completion_status (backlinks the
                       existing query-completions surface, not a fourth store),
                       divergence_from_plan, and tell_the_EM (freeform exit interview) --
                       distinct from --type run-report's lifecycle-tracker shape.
                       (docs/plans/2026-07-24-canonical-resolution-engine.md § W2-B3, R7 Addendum)

  Queue types (A4 — delegate to coordinator-queue-append, do NOT re-implement schema):
  improvement-queue  — DELEGATES to coordinator-queue-append --schema improvement-queue
  bug-backlog        — DELEGATES to coordinator-queue-append --schema bug-backlog
  debt-backlog       — DELEGATES to coordinator-queue-append --schema debt-backlog

  Lesson type (A4 — delegate to coordinator-lesson-promote, outbox/promote altitude):
  lesson             — DELEGATES to coordinator-lesson-promote
                       (lessons-outbox YAML, NOT a lessons.md capture line — per tc-2 D3)

  Workflow type (delegate to coordinator-workflow-scaffold.py, claude-klabauter workflow.scaffold op):
  workflow           — DELEGATES to coordinator-workflow-scaffold.py
                       requires --name (or --title) --description (or --title)
                       COMPUTE_ONLY op: returns Workflow-skeleton script text, not a
                       frontmatter document; writes to --out (or stdout when omitted)

Fail-loud on unknown --type: exits non-zero and lists the known type set.

For memo: uses the shared memo_compose.compose_frontmatter (extracted from
bin/cross-repo-memo) to emit validator-clean frontmatter. The memo delivery
surface (routing, realpath containment, claim-lock) stays wholly in cross-repo-memo.

Invocation:
  coordinator-doc-new --type handoff [--title "..."] [--branch "..."] [--out PATH]
  coordinator-doc-new --type spinoff [--title "..."] [--branch "..."] [--out PATH]
  coordinator-doc-new --type memo --to RECEIVER --topic SLUG --title "..." [--out PATH]
                                  [--from-repo SENDER]

Output: the scaffolded file path is printed to stdout.
Uncommitted — leaves the file dirty so it surfaces in `git status`.

Negative-spec: coordinator-doc-new does NOT deliver memos, route to receivers,
check realpath containment, stamp claim-locks, or manage the memo lifecycle. Those
surfaces belong wholly to bin/cross-repo-memo. This tool creates the LOCAL skeleton.

Negative-spec: does not modify any schema, skill, or hook — it reads schemas at
runtime to derive section vocabulary but does not write to any registry file.

    Memoizing wrapper over ``cc_invoke.ensure_engine_on_path`` — that function
    owns the ladder (env var → self-location walk-up → settings-home
    pointer file → machine-local ``repos.claude_klabauter``), so a hand-set
    ``PYTHONPATH`` is never a prerequisite of this CLI and the ordering cannot
    drift away from the ~26 sibling entrypoints resolving through the same seam.

    Called once at import time and again from each engine-touching seam below,
    so a published/vendored copy that only resolves through a later rung still
    gets the path in place on the arm that needs it. ``coordinator_core.ops``
    registers ops lazily, unconditionally, so the handoff arm's import budget
    needs no priming for that.

    Best-effort: returns None when every rung misses, matching this file's
    graceful-skip convention for un-migrated installs (see
    ``_assert_no_archived_handoff_twin``) rather than failing a scaffold that
    has no engine work to do.

    Memoization applies only to a SUCCESSFUL resolution — ``_CLAUDE_KLABAUTER_ROOT_RESOLVED``
    is only ever assigned a non-None value, so a failed/degraded resolution is
    never cached and re-attempts on every subsequent call. This costs repeated
    resolution work per call site on a failing install, not a correctness bug.

    Spec backlink: cross-repo memo — coordinator-doc-new broken from its .cmd
    forwarder (ModuleNotFoundError: coordinator_core without a hand-set

    Why by location. `coordinator/lib` and `coordinator/scripts/lib` are
    directories of scripts with no `__init__.py`, so both are PEP-420 implicit
    NAMESPACE packages. Whenever `coordinator/` precedes `coordinator/bin` on

    ``coordinator_core.ops.session_context.resolve_current_session_id``, which
    reads the per-request identity binding first and falls back COLD to the same
    precedence chain (COORDINATOR_SESSION_ID > CLAUDE_SESSION_ID >
    CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID) this file used to walk here directly. It is the same
    overall harness session identity coordinator_core.subagent_sandbox
    .provision_report reads via its spawn-time hook payload's `session_id` field
    (see that module's _provision()). The EM and every subagent it spawns via the
    Task tool share ONE harness session; provision_report captures that identity
    from the EM-side spawn hook's payload, while this path resolves it for the
    request being served -- same identity, two different capture points, not two
    mechanisms.

    WHY NOT A RAW ENV READ, which is what this was until 2026-08-30.
    `coordinator_core.baton_assemble.apply._load_doc_new_module` loads this file
    as a module and calls its scaffolder functions IN-PROCESS, and that module is
    reached from the registered op `handoff.correct_body`. So these functions run
    inside a warm server roughly 50 sessions share, where `os.environ` names
    whoever spawned the server rather than the session whose request is being
    served. The stamp was therefore intermittently correct -- right whenever the
    frozen env happened to match the caller -- which is worse than constantly
    wrong: five confirmed misattributions across claude-klabauter and project-rag in
    a single day, three of which reached a peer as a false ownership claim.
    Audit: state/audits/2026-08-30-author-stamp-resolves-machine-wide.md.

    Falls back to the literal 'em-unknown' when the identity does not resolve OR
    when the engine seam is unavailable. It does NOT fall back to a local env
    ladder: an unimportable `coordinator_core` cannot be distinguished from a warm
    context here, and a wrong id is not a better answer than a declared unknown.
    In practice `_ensure_engine_on_path`'s self-location rung resolves off this
    file's own path, so the no-engine leg is a broken install, not a consumer-repo
    cwd.

    ``## Session Ledger`` heading (C3) — the write-time backstop for "every
    present and future baton generator remembering to do so" that C1's
    generator-side emission alone cannot guarantee.

    Scoped to doc types whose kind or output path resolves to a schema in
    that corpus (``match_schema``/``match_schema_for_path``) — most doc
    types this CLI scaffolds (memo, plan, decision, completion, goal,
    review sidecars, etc.) have no schema in claude-klabauter's own ~14-schema corpus
    and resolve to no match, so this check is a no-op for them rather than
    a weakened warning: only doc types WITH a schema are actually enforced.
    Content with no parseable frontmatter is likewise left alone here (this
    is a self-check on the emitter's own output shape, not a general
    frontmatter-presence gate). The ledger-heading check is scoped the same
    way — it only ever runs on content whose frontmatter parsed and whose
    schema matched, so an unresolvable/malformed scaffold degrades exactly
    like the schema check does, never a separate failure mode.

    Degrades gracefully (skips the check, no exit) when ``repo_root`` cannot
    be resolved or when ``coordinator_core`` cannot be imported — mirrors
    ``_assert_no_archived_handoff_twin``'s existing graceful-skip convention
    for un-migrated installs, rather than hard-failing every scaffold on an
    environment this tool already tolerates elsewhere. A schema-corpus load
    or frontmatter-parse failure degrades the same way (fail-open — never
    block a write on the self-check's own infra trouble); only an actual
    schema-shape violation, or a ledger-owing kind missing its heading, on
    the generated content triggers the hard exit.

    claim on, for the C1/AC1 session-state parent tier.

    Reads SESSION STATE only (`coordinator_core.session.claims` /

    has no session-state claim on itself yet, and its own `predecessor_handoff`
    field is emitted commented out; see
    `coordinator_core.ops.deliverable_carry.resolve_session_state_parent_
    deliverable_id`'s docstring for why a scaffold-time read of that field is
    always empty).

    Scans only `handoff-claims` (the class roadmap stubs — `kind: roadmap-
    baton`, or the retired `kind: spinoff-roadmap` still found on archived
    stubs — are claimed under; memo/plan claims cannot carry such a stub) and
    resolves each claimed basename against `state/handoffs/<basename>` first,
    falling back to `archive/handoffs/**/<basename>` (a handoff claim survives
    both ship and archive) — the FIRST resolvable file wins, where "first" is
    ALPHABETICAL by basename (this caller uses the unchecked
    `list_claims_by_session` wrapper, which iterates claims in the same
    `sorted(class_dir.iterdir())` order as `list_claims_by_session_checked` —
    see that function's docstring for the underlying read semantics — but
    discards its `errors` arm; an unresolvable session-state store is treated
    identically to "holds nothing", which is the intended degrade-to-empty
    behaviour for this advisory resolution, not a bug). Ordering is NOT
    chronological, so under multiple concurrent roadmap stubs in one
    session the earliest-alphabetical basename wins regardless of claim
    recency (mirrors this file's existing graceful, no-detector-for-concurrent-
    stubs posture; see the plan's Critical-1 review note for the known
    residual gap).

    The actual `kind` gate (which values count as a roadmap stub) lives in
    `coordinator_core.ops.deliverable_carry._ROADMAP_STUB_KINDS`, applied by
    `resolve_session_state_parent_deliverable_id` — this function only
    resolves a candidate PATH from session state; it does not itself inspect
    `kind`.

    holds no handoff-class claim, or no claimed basename resolves to a real

    Reconciled (2026-07-08, lvv-01/C1) onto the ONE canonical uniqueness basis
    shared across every mint site in this codebase — the shell/JS basis:
    sha1(slug|epoch-SECONDS|pid|random)[:6]. Before this reconciliation,
    two DIFFERENT bases had already diverged on disk: this function's predecessor
    (_mint_plan_id) used epoch-MICROSECONDS with NO random component, while
    bin/mint-deliverable-id.py (the cross-language seam also mirrored in
    bin/normalize-handoff-frontmatter.js's mintDeliverableIdFromSlug) used
    epoch-seconds + pid + $RANDOM. The shell/JS basis is canonical because it is
    the one with real cross-language callers (mint-deliverable-id.py is invoked
    from skills/handoff, skills/spinoff, skills/roadmap-planning, and mirrored
    independently in JS) — this function now matches that formula instead of
    adding a third divergent variant. Slug truncated to 30 chars so the id stays
    manageable; inputs are commonly pre-truncated to 40 chars by callers
    (see _slug_from_title) already, so this 30-char clamp is a defensive
    re-clamp, not the primary truncation point.

    Parity note (review finding, lvv-01/A F1/F5): this reconciliation matches
    the shell/JS basis on hash-input SHAPE (slug|epoch-seconds|pid|random),
    NOT on the exact random-number range. Python (random.randint(0, 65535))
    and the JS mirror (Math.floor(Math.random() * 65536)) both draw from a
    16-bit range; bash's $RANDOM is a 15-bit PRNG yielding [0, 32767]. Python
    and JS agree with each other but neither matches bash's exact entropy
    range — the "same formula" claim holds on shape, not on this one axis.
    Not a correctness issue (collision odds remain comfortably low either
    way); flagging so a future reader doesn't assume bit-for-bit parity.

    Provenance note (review finding, corpus-sweep F2): a hand-cured or swept
    id's 6-hex suffix (e.g. an archived record whose handoff_id was rewritten
    to fix a stale/placeholder slug while preserving the original hex) is NOT
    reproducible from that record's current slug — the hex above is only ever
    computed from the slug at the moment of a fresh mint. Do not infer
    slug-hex provenance for an id that could have been hand-cured after mint.

    Cost, MEASURED not reasoned (2026-08-30, this box, 34 live registry

    suggests. 4.69ms cpu / 5.18ms wall per call, against `self_record()`'s
    1.56ms for the one file it read. A ~3ms delta, once per scaffold
    invocation and never in a loop, is 0.6% of the 500ms brightline and
    clears it. Do not restore the O(1) leg to buy that back: `self_record()`
    is keyed on `CLAUDE_PID`, which is the defect. If this ever moves onto a
    per-item path, hoist one `snapshot()` above the loop rather than reverting
    the key.

    The name this returns is the
    harness's own per-session identity (`slug(basename(cwd)) + "-" +
    one-random-byte-hex`, see `coordinator_core.session.reachability`'s module
    docstring), generated independently of whether cross-session messaging is
    bound, so it is present far more often than a `SendMessage`-ready
    `name [ref]` address would be (that bracketed form additionally requires
    `messaging_socket_path`, which is off by default — see
    `harness_registry.self_record`'s own docstring, "44/44 records on this box

    WHY THE UUID IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. A display name is not an identifier:
    the harness mints it as `slug(basename(cwd)) + one random byte`, so two
    live sessions in one repo collide on it routinely — three duplicate pairs
    were visible in a single `ListAgents` on 2026-08-30. A name alone in a
    durable record cannot be resolved back to a session by any later reader,
    and there is no historical name->uuid map to recover it from, so the value
    has to be written at mint time or it is lost. It was: a bug row crediting
    "claude-klabauter-49" reached the wrong one of two live sessions with that
    name, and the correction had to be hand-applied.

    The name is KEPT rather than replaced. It is what a human scanning
    frontmatter recognises, and it is what `ListAgents` shows; the uuid beside
    it is what makes the line checkable. `self_record()` already returns the
    pair, so the uuid costs nothing but was being discarded.

    Fallbacks — the field is required, so this never returns empty: name plus
    uuid when the session resolves, else `_resolve_from_repo()`'s repo-level
    identity. Never fabricates either half. Both halves now derive from a
    SINGLE `_resolve_session_id()` result (see WHY THE UUID IS NOT OPTIONAL
    HERE, below), so the bare-name shape (`author: claude-klabauter-d8`, a name
    with no uuid) that a two-ladder resolution used to permit is unreachable:
    an unresolvable session yields no name either and drops straight to the

    _slug_from_title and on into the durable id mints, producing ids like

    title afterwards — the id is minted once, at scaffold time, and nothing re-mints
    it. Callers use this predicate to REFUSE to mint rather than bake a
    placeholder-derived value into a durable, cross-repo identifier.

    Why refusal beats a placeholder id: a placeholder id is *well-formed*. It matches

      roadmap-baton — its identity is its `stub_id`, not a discovered chain
                (D1); the stub path above already mints from it.
      plan — plan authoring ALREADY asks this question, one tier earlier and

                state_parent_deliverable_id` reads the very same session-held

                tiers must not answer the same question about the same file
                two ways; for `plan` the kind-gated one is authoritative.

    deliberately rooting a NEW deliverable while a claim on another chain is

    - `narrow_catch=False` (the `plan` arm, formerly `_resolve_explicit_

      sizing_deliverable_id`'s own never-raises posture.
    - `narrow_catch=True` (the newly-reached-type fallthrough): only
      catches the enumerated `(DroppedDeliverableJoinError,
      DivergentDeliverableIdError)` family (AC9's chunk body — "enumerate
      them from deliverable_carry.py, do not catch bare Exception"); on

      against the real callee today
      (test_ac9_error_family_discovery_matches_known_baseline pins it).

    Both branches mint the final `deliverable_id` themselves (`carry` on a

    each call site reduces to a single assignment. `deliverable_carry.py`'s

    Produces a conformant handoff (kind: session-handoff) against the handoff schema.
    Cross-field required fields for post-2026-05-29 created dates: category, summary.
    All required fields are present with placeholder values the EM replaces via Edit.

    deliverable_id and initiative are D9 present-as-null: emitted as 'null' when
    not supplied, never key-absent. deliverable_id is auto-inherited from the
    DELIVERABLE_ID env var (set by the skill when a plan's session is active) or
    minted fresh when no parent id is discoverable from session context.

    handoff_id (lvv-01/C1) is the new durable-link stable ID (hnd-<slug>-<6hex>),
    OPTIONAL in the schema — omitted entirely (not emitted as null) when not
    supplied, matching the schema's "optional, no migration" backfill policy for
    pre-existing artifacts that predate this field.

    origin_handoff_id/predecessor_id (C2, ID-companions) are pure carry-through —
    the calling skill resolves the value by reading handoff_id off the artifact
    the companion's path field (origin_handoff/predecessor) names; this scaffolder
    never resolves or mints them. Omitted entirely (not null) when not supplied,
    matching handoff_id's optional-omit convention above.

    predecessor (the path field predecessor_id companions) is carry-through on
    the same terms — the caller supplies a repo-relative path to the baton this
    handoff continues, and this scaffolder neither resolves nor validates it.
    Defaults to the literal 'none' when not supplied, so a fork (and every
    pre-existing caller) scaffolds byte-identically to before this parameter
    existed. Only the session-handoff scaffolder takes it: the spinoff kinds are
    predecessor:none-by-design (schema_validate.py Rule A3a-3
    _cf_spinoff_predecessor_none) and the recovery baton's 'predecessor' means a
    crashed commit SHA, not a baton path — neither may be threaded here.

    additional_predecessors (--additional-predecessor, repeatable) is the
    successor-side down-edge of a fan-in succession: the extra parent batons
    beyond `predecessor`. Carry-through on the same terms as predecessor —
    neither resolved nor normalized here; the calling engine (baton_assemble's
    `_build_directives`) renders every entry repo-relative before it arrives,
    because the schema's cross-field integrity rule
    (`_cf_additional_predecessors_integrity`) compares by EXACT STRING, so an
    unnormalized entry would evade the duplicate-of-primary check. Emitted as a
    YAML block sequence when non-empty; the key is omitted entirely when empty,
    matching handoff_id/predecessor_id's optional-omit convention above and
    `pickup_assemble._LIST_FIELD_KEYS`, which already parses this field as a
    multi-line list.

    Duplicate entries, and an entry equal to `predecessor`, are refused
    (fail-loud) rather than silently deduped — the same posture as the
    predecessor_id-without-predecessor refusal below, and for the same reason:
    the scaffolder must not be able to author frontmatter the validator will
    then reject. Deduping silently would also hide a genuine caller bug (a
    fan-in leg resolved twice) behind a clean-looking artifact.

    Spec backlink: roadmap stub sedge-02 (state/roadmap/sedge-2026-08-06/),
    § Successor-side back-edge on a fan-in.

    summary (--summary) replaces the hardcoded placeholder summary when
    supplied; the placeholder is emitted unchanged when omitted (byte-identical
    to before this parameter existed). Refused fail-loud when blank or over the
    handoff schema's 140-char cap (_cf_summary_length_cap) — the caller fixes it
    here rather than the scaffolder authoring frontmatter the validator will
    then reject.

    readiness trio directly (C3, docs/plans/2026-08-19-gate-notes-are-

    pickup_ready) is DERIVED from that via `reconcile.gate_eval
    .derive_readiness` (C1) — the same one-evaluator seam every other reader
    of `blocked_by` goes through, rather than this scaffolder hardcoding
    awaiting_gate/pickup_ready:false itself. Against an empty resolution
    index (scaffold time has no corpus to check) an unresolved id derives
    awaiting_gate/pickup_ready:false, matching the pre-C3 DR-173-trio output
    for the common case. Omitted → `blocked_by: []` derives ready_to_fire/
    pickup_ready:true, byte-identical to today (AC2). Refused fail-loud when
    blank. Refused fail-loud (not silently degraded) when the engine is
    unresolvable, since a caller supplying --gated-open needs the derivation
    to actually run — the no-flag path degrades gracefully instead (see
    body), because it must not gain an engine dependency it never had.

    gate_note (--gate-note) sets `blocking_notes` ONLY — it is advisory
    prose and, per the 2026-08-19 ruling, must NEVER flip readiness; only
    `blocked_by` may. Two flags because they are two concepts: --gated-open
    declares the mechanical blocker, --gate-note carries the human-readable
    reason. Legal alone (leaves the baton pickup_ready — this is the CLI-
    surface assertion of the ruling, AC4) and legal together with
    --gated-open (a blocked baton that also carries a note). Refused
    fail-loud when blank.

    Supplying predecessor_id WITHOUT predecessor is refused (fail-loud). The two
    are the ID and path representations of one edge, and the referential-integrity
    checker cannot catch the inconsistent pairing — it explicitly skips the
    comparison when the path field is unset ('ID present, path absent — nothing to
    compare', schema_validate.py _check_handoff_id_refs). A scaffold emitting
    predecessor: none alongside a real predecessor_id is self-contradictory
    frontmatter that validates clean, so the refusal has to live here, at the only
    point that has both values in hand.

    handoff_phase is emitted unconditionally as the literal 'continuation' —
    a third emission pattern distinct from deliverable_id/initiative's
    present-as-null and handoff_id's optional-omit above. execution_authorized_*
    fields (by/at/sha/note) are deliberately NOT scaffolded here — they are
    stamped only at execution-authorization time, not at generic scaffold.

    authoring_session (2026-07-30, cross-authorship adoption gap) is stamped
    from `_resolve_session_id()` — the SAME resolver + precedence chain this
    file already uses for --type run-report and --type subagent-sidecar's
    `dispatched_by` field. Omitted entirely (not null, not 'PLACEHOLDER') when
    the resolver yields only its own 'em-unknown' fallback sentinel —
    matching handoff_id's optional-omit convention above, not the literal
    PLACEHOLDER string the OTHER scaffolders (spinoff/goal-seed/roadmap-seed)
    emit for a human to fill in later via EM Edit. That distinction is
    load-bearing, not cosmetic: `coordinator_core.baton_assemble
    ._adopt_prior_attempt_scaffold_path` gates cross-authorship adoption on
    this field being a machine-trustworthy fact, and a stray 'em-unknown' or
    'PLACEHOLDER' string sitting in it would be exactly the operator-typed
    prose that predicate's docstring says it must never gate on.

    category (--category) is validated against _HANDOFF_CATEGORY_ENUM before the
    frontmatter is written (fail-loud, naming all legal values on mismatch) —
    defaults to 'infra' unchanged when not supplied (behavior-preserving default).
    Spec backlink: cross-repo/inbox/2026-07-23-example-cockpit-repo-em-coordinator-doc-new-category-no-validation.md

    deliverable_ids/plan_ids (--deliverable-ids/--plan-ids, repeatable, C1 plural
    carriers) are pure carry-through on the same terms as additional_predecessors:
    never resolved or minted here. Emitted as a YAML block sequence ONLY when the
    corresponding flag was supplied at all (list is not None) — omitted entirely
    (not `[]`, not `null`) when the flag was never passed. The 2+-distinct-id
    threshold that decides WHEN a caller passes these flags is not decided here
    (C2 owns it); this scaffolder emits exactly what it is handed.
    The singular --deliverable-id emission above is untouched by this addition —
    it does not route the singular value through these new flags.

    gate_dependency (deprecated), blocked_by, or blocking_notes; category/summary
    required post-2026-05-29).

    `blocks` (--blocks, repeatable) is the ONE graph field that is carried rather
    than stubbed, because it is the one a continuation SILENTLY LOSES. A roadmap
    baton picked up mid-flight mints a successor under the same `stub_id`; the
    successor got `blocks: []` from the placeholder list below while the whole
    down-graph still pointed at that `stub_id`, so every dependent's
    `blocks`/`blocked_by` symmetry check read the edge as severed and
    `reconcile.gate_eval._has_asymmetry` reported a symmetric graph as a data
    defect. Losing an edge on continuation is not a placeholder to fill in later —
    nothing tells the author it went missing. Carried through VERBATIM, never
    resolved, deduped, or validated here: the caller (baton_assemble's
    `_resolved_predecessor_roadmap_identity`) reads the predecessor's own authored
    list and this scaffolder emits exactly what it is handed, on the same
    carry-through terms as `--deliverable-ids`/`--additional-predecessor`. Omitted
    → `blocks: []`, byte-identical to every caller that does not pass it.

    `predecessor` (--predecessor) is carried on exactly the same grounds, and was
    added for the same failure: `baton_assemble`'s succession directive passes
    `--predecessor=<the baton being superseded>` on every roadmap-baton handoff,
    argparse accepted it, this scaffolder never took the parameter, and the
    successor was written `predecessor: none` with nothing warning. The lineage
    edge the supersession had just stamped in the other direction
    (`continued_into` on the predecessor) was therefore missing on the successor
    half, so the chain read as broken from one end only. Schema permits it: the
    `predecessor=none/null` cross-field rule binds `spinoff`/`goal-seed`/
    `roadmap-seed`, and `roadmap-baton` is not in that class. Carried VERBATIM on
    the same terms as `blocks` — never resolved, validated, or minted here.
    Omitted → `predecessor: none`, byte-identical to every caller that does not
    pass it.

    Still NOT carried, named rather than silently dropped: `blocked_by`, `sprint`,
    `wave`. `blocked_by` is deliberately excluded — it is DERIVED readiness state
    (`--gated-open` owns it, and `_derive_readiness` reads it), so inheriting a
    predecessor's gates would re-park a successor on blockers that may have since
    cleared. `sprint`/`wave` are topo-sort outputs owned by
    `bin/roadmap-number-stubs`, not lineage.

    Graph field placeholders (sprint, wave, cost, blocked_by, scope) are
    best-effort stubs — the author fills them via Edit after the topo sort via
    bin/roadmap-number-stubs (skills/roadmap-planning/SKILL.md § Step 2.1.5).
    gate_dependency is the deprecated single-string gate field (C2); when not
    supplied a scaffolded stub instead gets a blocking_notes placeholder (C1 of
    docs/plans/2026-08-03-gate-dependency-template-emission-spec.md) — the
    non-deprecated field satisfies the same cross-field OR without writing the
    field the template was deprecating it away from.

    pickup_ready is OMITTED per SKILL § Phase 2.1 note: absence triggers a non-blocking
    /pickup warn; awaiting_gate + a named gate (blocking_notes, gate_dependency, or
    blocked_by) is the real sequencing gate.

    deliverable_id is auto-minted from stub_id when not supplied (D1: roadmap stubs
    reuse stub identity → dlv-<stub_id>). initiative is D9 present-as-null.

    sizing_object is emitted as a real frontmatter key, mirroring the `plan` arm.
    A roadmap arrives THROUGH the sizing lobby and every stub is assigned its own
    `loe:` at mint, so a roadmap baton IS sized work — the FK simply went
    unwritten, which left PM-ratified stubs reading `unsized` to
    `coordinator_core.sizing_disposition` and would have bounced them back to the
    lobby to re-make a size that already existed. The literal string "null" (from
    --no-sizing-object) emits an explicit `sizing_object: null` — the checkable
    declaration of absence, never a silent omission.

    handoff_id (lvv-01/C1) is the new durable-link stable ID (hnd-<slug>-<6hex>) —
    roadmap-baton was excluded from the handoff-id-minting doc_type tuple at C1
    (real asymmetry, not a documented exception; see AC13 backfill fix). Omitted
    entirely (not null) when not supplied, matching every other handoff-family
    scaffold's optional-omit convention above.

    as DISTINCT sections per D2).

    is a retired row family (forward-only, PM ruling 2026-08-27, DoE-claude

    everything else rides `prime_exit_criterion`'s falsifier delta. Existing

    here to match them.

    plan_id is minted fresh (pln-<slug>-<6hex>) — always present, never null (D3).
    deliverable_id is auto-inherited from DELIVERABLE_ID env var or minted fresh
    when no parent id is discoverable from session context (D1).
    initiative is D9 present-as-null (null when this plan has no named initiative).
    sizing_object, when supplied, is emitted as a real frontmatter key (its
    on-disk resolution is asserted by the caller before this function runs —
    see main()'s --sizing-object validation block). When omitted, the existing
    commented-optional-key skeleton is left unchanged (no behavior change).

    problem_set, when supplied, is emitted as a real frontmatter key (a ratified
    problem-set slug, or the literal 'inline') instead of the commented
    `# problem_set: inline` template line — the DoE census's requested bind to
    the generic insert_fm_field-plus-a-key shape; no new named op required.
    When omitted, the existing commented-optional-key skeleton is left

    required — a plan with no ratified problem set simply leaves the

    """Return sizing-object YAML text with `plan:` and `status:` set.

    Whole-document-YAML (no frontmatter fence) — same shape `_scaffold_sizing`
    emits. Line-level regex substitution (replace an existing `status:`/
    `plan:` line in place, else append a new one) rather than a full
    load+dump: this file is hand-authored prose-adjacent YAML (comments,
    the sizing skill's own formatting), and a parse/re-dump round-trip would
    silently drop both, exactly the failure class this repo's `sizing-
    object.schema.json` vendoring note calls out for schema files (STRUCTURAL
    MERGE, NOT A BYTE COPY) — the same discipline applies to instance data.

    `status:` is forced to `_SIZING_REVERSE_STATUS`, UNLESS the sizing's
    existing `status:` is already terminal (`shipped`) — see the guard below
    (Review: staff-eng — Finding 6: a scaffold against an already-shipped
    sizing must not silently re-route/un-ship it). Otherwise this is the
    plan-creation writer's own value, independent of whatever non-terminal
    value the sizing already carried (draft/sized/routed), matching a plan
    now existing for the route this sizing chose. `plan:` is set/overwritten
    to `plan_repo_rel_path` (repo-root-relative, POSIX-normalized, matching
    the schema's `^docs/plans/.+\\.md$` pattern) — UNLESS the sizing already
    carries a different, non-null `plan:` value. When that happens this is
    either a genuine RE-ROUTE or a shape->roadmap FAN-OUT, and that
    distinction is NOT decidable from what is on disk here — both look
    identical: a sizing already citing one plan, and a second plan asking to
    cite it too. It is a fact about the CALLER's intent, so the caller
    asserts it via `fan_out` (CLI: `--fan-out`), the same way DR-411 rules a
    mode is asserted by the launching environment and never sniffed from
    state:

    1. `fan_out` is True -> FAN-OUT. Permit; do not raise, and do NOT
       overwrite `plan:` -- the cascade holds the terminal fact and replaces
       it at either plan's `status: implemented`. (The caller is also
       responsible for minting THIS plan its own `deliverable_id` rather
       than carrying the cited sizing's, so the two plans do not fork one
       deliverable in two — see the `plan` arm's cited-sizing-carry tier in
       `main()`.)
    2. `fan_out` is False (default) -> REFUSE, exactly as before. A previous
       revision tried to infer this instead by comparing the existing
       plan's on-disk `deliverable_id` against an `incoming_deliverable_id`
       — defeated on the ordinary path (a sizing's `deliverable_id` is
       carried verbatim into every citing plan by default, so two plans
       compared EQUAL and a genuine fan-out was refused), and unsound in the
       other direction too (once a caller-side fix stopped that carry after
       first routing, a genuine RE-ROUTE minted a fresh id just like a
       fan-out would and was silently permitted). Removed rather than kept
       as a second, weaker gate that could disagree with the flag.

    A `plan:` value byte-identical to `plan_repo_rel_path` is treated as
    idempotent, not a clobber (re-running the same scaffold) and never
    reaches this branch at all.

    Review: staff-eng — Findings 2/3: this used to hand-roll its own
    `re.search`/`re.sub` line surgery instead of composing
    `coordinator_core.frontmatter.primitives` — the exact defect class that
    module's own docstring names ("three hand-copies ... each independently
    reproduced the corruption"). Two concrete corruptions this closes: (a)
    the old `\\s*`-based `plan:` read walked past a present-but-empty
    `plan:` line's own newline and captured the FOLLOWING line's text as the
    "existing FK" — `read_fm_field_unquoted` uses the primitives' own
    negative-spec'd `[ \\t]`-only padding, never `\\s`; (b) the old
    `re.MULTILINE` `re.sub(r"(?m)^status:.*$", ...)` consumed a CRLF
    document's trailing `\\r` on the rewritten line without re-emitting it,
    leaving the file with MIXED line endings —
    `replace_fm_field_raw`/`insert_fm_field_raw` re-emit/adopt the document's
    own EOL, so this can no longer happen. `plan:`'s own quoting stays this
    file's `_yaml_quote` convention (always double-quoted) rather than
    `serialize_yaml_scalar`'s bare-unless-structural rule, matching this
    reverse edge's own pre-existing on-disk shape and this suite's fixtures —
    both the replace branch (`replace_fm_field_raw`) and the insert branch
    (`insert_fm_field_raw`) take the pre-quoted `_plan_raw` value, so neither
    branch can diverge from the other's quoting.

    Review: coordinator:code-reviewer — the insert branch used to call
    `insert_fm_field` with the raw unquoted path, which serializes via
    `serialize_yaml_scalar`'s bare-unless-structural rule and left a
    first-time scaffold's `plan:` unquoted while a re-run (replace branch)
    was double-quoted — the docstring's always-double-quoted claim was false
    on that branch. `insert_fm_field_raw` (added to the primitives module,
    mirroring `replace_fm_field_raw`) closes the gap.

    WHY THIS SPLIT EXISTS. The check above validates the document AFTER the
    edge's text surgery, and was added to catch surgery that produces an
    invalid document (a `plan:` value the schema's path pattern rejects).
    But it fires just as readily on a sizing object that was ALREADY invalid
    when it arrived -- the surgery only writes `status` and `plan`, so it
    cannot be the cause of an error on any other field. Reported 2026-09-06:
    a planner was told "post-mutation schema validation failed:
    em_review: additional property not allowed", read it as the reverse edge
    misbehaving, and refused to route around it -- correctly, and against the
    wrong suspect. The message named a real defect and pointed at the one
    component that had not caused it.

    So the pre-mutation document is validated too, and the errors are
    partitioned: an error already present before the edge is the DOCUMENT's,
    an error only present after is the EDGE's. Both are still refusals --
    this changes what the operator is told, never what is written.

    UNKNOWN TOP-LEVEL KEY GETS A NAMED ALTERNATIVE. `additionalProperties`
    is `false` on this schema, and the way that fires in practice is an EM
    writing prose under a key they invented on the spot (`em_review`,
    2026-09-06). The schema already has a home for exactly that --
    `em_analysis`, a free-form topic-keyed object of strings, whose own
    description names `em_resolution` as an example key -- so the refusal
    names it rather than leaving the writer to re-derive it or, worse, to

    executor-written, post-run), and dispatch_feed (INERT placeholder — the
    field is optional/claude-klabauter-emitter-written per pcli-04/C3, executor-READ-ONLY;
    emitted as a block-style object containing ONLY the sub-fields with a
    real value at scaffold time (`gate_kind: none`, `write_files: []`) —
    every other declared sub-property (label/agent_type/model/effort/
    schema_ref/brief_ref/est_min) admits no null in run-report.schema.json
    and is OMITTED rather than null-valued (dispatch_feed has no `required`
    list and `additionalProperties: true`, so omission validates cleanly),
    per _DISPATCH_FEED_BLOCK_LINES above — matching the corrected shape
    coordinator_core.subagent_sandbox.provision_report._frontmatter emits
    (C6, commit 8571f7f22273, corrected in C6b after a staff review found
    C6's original all-null-subfields shape was schema-invalid). Field shape
    matches the printf the retired fan-out-dispatch.sh (DoE 65e5d199,
    2026-07-19) used to emit for the fields it still shares.

    This function is the former _scaffold_flight_recorder, renamed and extended
    for the run-report subsume (plan: 2026-07-13-subagent-run-report-subsume.md,
    chunk C4). --type flight-recorder remains a caller-facing BACKWARD-COMPAT
    ALIAS for --type run-report (see main()'s doc_type normalization) so in-flight
    callers (fan-out-dispatch.sh, pre-C5 executors) do not break.

    divergence is emitted in BLOCK style (key on its own line, nested `diverged:`
    indented below), NOT flow style (`divergence: {diverged: false}`) — this
    repo's minimal YAML parser (bin/lib/schema.js parseYaml) does not support
    flow-style mappings and would parse a flow-style value as a raw string,
    failing the object-shaped schema check (divergence: type object, required
    [diverged], additionalProperties: false). Block style is the only shape
    that parses correctly under the real validator. This is the OBJECT form
    mandated by DEC-3's reconcile — NEVER an array (a bare `divergence: []`
    does not validate against the object-typed schema; see run-report.schema.json's
    divergence property and the C10 retirement-gate assertion that guards this).

    agent_type is OPTIONAL (defaults to the literal "executor" when omitted) —
    the universal field naming which subagent kind was spawned (e.g. executor,
    review-integrator, code-reviewer); flight-recorder-shaped callers (fan-out-
    dispatch.sh chunk dispatch) always spawn an executor, so the default covers
    that call shape without requiring every caller to pass --agent-type.

    FRONTMATTER-BEARING as of the run-report/review-findings schema unification (docs/plans/
    2026-07-24-reviewer-sidecar-provisioning-reconciliation.md): mirrors coordinator_core.
    subagent_sandbox.provision_report.py's ``_frontmatter()`` block byte-shape (same keys,
    same order: status/agent_type/spawned_at/lead_session_id/divergence/commits/
    dispatch_feed) so a self-scaffolded file is shape-identical to a provision_report-
    provisioned one -- both now validate against the SAME superset ``run-report.schema.json``
    (``applies_to: .coordinator-local/subagent-share/*/*.md``, ``required: ["status"]``), and the now-
    retired ``review-findings.schema.json`` no-frontmatter special-case is gone. ``agent_type``
    is stamped as the literal 'review-findings' (this scaffolder's doc TYPE, not a spawned
    agent's role -- provision_report's own agent_type field records the SPAWNED agent's type
    instead, e.g. 'code-reviewer'; the two producers diverge on this one field's semantic,
    not its presence).

    Emits a lightweight markdown skeleton consumed by agents/code-reviewer.md:
    a heading, Reviewer/Scope/Diff-range metadata lines, and a ## Findings section whose
    body is the single literal sentinel line <!-- FINDINGS -->. The reviewer replaces the
    sentinel via a single Edit so the full findings body lands in one atomic write, making
    no-ops detectable (the sentinel survives an Edit that touched nothing meaningful) and
    bounding the reviewer to one write action per slice.

    Negative-spec: does NOT reuse provision_report's own review-findings sentinel text
    (``<!-- One entry per finding: ... -->``) -- that producer's sentinel diverges from the
    ``<!-- FINDINGS -->`` anchor agents/code-reviewer.md and this schema's description
    document; this scaffolder keeps the documented ``<!-- FINDINGS -->`` anchor rather than
    silently adopting the other producer's different sentinel text. Pre-existing divergence,
    out of scope for this shape-unification fix.

    This is the SOLE self-persist scaffold path -- reached only when a code-reviewer
    dispatch arrived with NO sidecar pre-provisioned by the dispatching EM (the common
    case is engine-side spawn-time provisioning via
    coordinator_core.subagent_sandbox.provision_report, reached from
    coordinator_core.hooks.cater_subagent_start on SubagentStart, which this scaffolder
    never duplicates). Code-reviewer returns the path in its DONE line either way.

    Output path: .coordinator-local/subagent-share/<session-id>/YYYY-MM-DD-codereview-slice<ID>-<SLUG>.md
    -- the DR-091 one-home (docs/decisions/DR-091-agent-citizenship-identity-typed-sidecar-
    contract.md), the SAME .coordinator-local/subagent-share/<session>/ root provision_report.py's
    _provision() already writes to for the pre-provisioned (common) path. <session-id> is
    resolved by _resolve_session_id() below using the identical env var + precedence chain
    coordinator-doc-new already uses for --type run-report/subagent-sidecar's
    `dispatched_by` (COORDINATOR_SESSION_ID > CLAUDE_SESSION_ID > CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID) --
    this is the same overall harness session identity provision_report reads from its
    spawn-time hook payload's `session_id` field, just resolved from the running process's
    own environment instead of a payload, since a self-scaffold has no payload to read.
    Path formula is pinned here and in schemas/review-findings.schema.json's description.

    Confinement note: the Edit write-sandbox structural confinement (formerly "Mode A",
    restricting Edit to a fixed directory) was removed 2026-07-15 (DR-058) -- writing ONLY
    the findings sidecar is now a discipline the code-reviewer agent prompt upholds by

    subagent-sidecar: the plan->wiki->prior-art divergence-truth pipeline).

    Class-asymmetric behavior (R7 Addendum) is NOT encoded as a scaffolded
    field here -- it is a confinement/tool-grant property of the DISPATCHING

    structured write-back; named Opus personas: offered-not-imposed, may
