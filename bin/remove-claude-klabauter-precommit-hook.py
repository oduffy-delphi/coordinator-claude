"""
remove-claude-klabauter-precommit-hook — standalone remover for claude-klabauter's
registry-driven `.git/hooks/pre-commit` gate chain.

Purpose: `.git/hooks/` is untracked and per-clone — no commit this repo makes
can ever repair a hook already installed on another machine. When a future
change deletes the gate chain this hook calls out to (see
`coordinator_core.ops.install_claude_klabauter_precommit_hook`), every clone still
carrying an installed hook would BLOCK every commit with "missing script"
until this remover (or a re-run of the installer) runs. This script exists
so that remediation is always already on disk, in whatever commit deletes
the gate chain or earlier — see
`docs/plans/2026-08-25-the-staged-rollback-gate-dies-without-blocking-a-commit.md`
chunk C1.

Resolution axis (stated explicitly per that plan's Anti-scope): this module
is FULLY STANDALONE — no `coordinator_core` import, no engine-root
resolution, `pathlib`/`subprocess` only. It deliberately does NOT model its
root resolution on `coordinator/bin/check-registry-codename-leak.py`, whose
`_import_runner()` reaches the DISPATCH axis
(`require_dispatch_engine_on_path()`, the published-mirror resolver) — that
is the exact resolution that makes `install-claude-klabauter-precommit-hook.py`
unreachable from its own CLI today, and reproducing it here would leave this
remover exposed to the identical failure mode it exists to route around.

Idempotent, refuses to touch a foreign hook: only ever removes
`.git/hooks/pre-commit` when it carries the registry banner this repo's
installer stamps into every hook it writes
(`"Registry-driven (coordinator_core.ops.install_claude_klabauter_precommit_hook)"`).
An absent hook or a hook lacking that banner (operator-authored, or authored
by some other tool) is left alone — this script never blind-unlinks a hook
it did not write.

Resolves the git COMMON dir (`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`), not a bare
`.git/` join — `.git` is a file (not a directory) inside a linked worktree
or a submodule checkout, and the hooks directory for either lives at the
common dir, not at the per-worktree `.git` path.

Usage:
    remove-claude-klabauter-precommit-hook [target-repo-root]

    target-repo-root defaults to the current working directory.

Negative-spec:
    - Never imports `coordinator_core` or resolves an engine root — this
      script must keep running after both the installer op module and its
      CLI trampoline are deleted (see the plan chunk that deletes them).
    - Never removes a hook that does not carry the registry banner —
      an operator-authored or foreign-tool-authored hook is left in place,
      always, with a named stderr message.
    - Never assumes `.git` is a directory — resolves the git common dir via
      `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` so worktrees and submodules resolve
      correctly.

_USAGE = f"""usage: {_PROG} [REPO_PATH]

Remove an installed .git/hooks/pre-commit that this coordinator installer
generated. REPO_PATH defaults to the current directory; the git common dir is
resolved from it, so worktrees and submodules land on the shared hooks dir.

Exits 0 and changes nothing when there is no hook, when REPO_PATH is not a git
repo, or when the installed hook does not carry the registry banner -- a hook
this installer did not generate is never unlinked. Exits 1 only on a real I/O
failure.

Note: removing the hook is the FIX for a stale installed gate, not the fastest
unblock. An operator who merely needs to commit can use `git commit
--no-verify` (which still runs prepare-commit-msg, so commit trailers survive).
