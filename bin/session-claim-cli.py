# session-claim-cli — CLI trampoline over claude-klabauter
# coordinator_core.session.claims (the claim-lock primitives: claim_artifact /
# release_artifact / clear_claim_if_dead / claim_plan). Direct-import variant,
# mirroring coordinator/bin/archive-stamp-cli.py's resolve/import/dispatch/exit
# shape (template-variant #1: a plain in-process function call after
# resolving the engine root, no cc_invoke/IPC hop — these functions are plain
# module functions in claims.py, NOT registered coordinator_core.invoke ops).
#
# is-session-live / list-stale-claim-handoffs (2026-07-23) are a SEPARATE
# exposure of coordinator_core.session.liveness / coordinator_core.session.
# stale_claims. They were built for a sibling repo's bash skill (DoE's
# workstream-complete Step 0 crash-recovery fix, DoE fd5d61ccb) — that
# consumer NO LONGER EXISTS: DoE removed it at ada28dbe5 when their
# workstream-complete converted to the computed-skill shape and session-shape
# became assembler-computed. Verified 2026-08-10: no DoE surface invokes
# is-session-live, and DoE calls this CLI only for claim-plan and
# release-artifact. Do NOT read the exit-code contract below as a foreign
# contract needing cross-repo coordination to change. It still needs to be
# right: who-claims-path shares these arms and is named as an operator
# inspection instrument in coordinator_core/ops/ceremony/scoped_git_commit.py's
# refusal remedy (_CLAIM_CONFLICT_REMEDY, a human-facing string) — grep does
# not support any automated in-repo stdout consumer of this CLI as of
# 2026-08-10 (Review: staff-eng slice-A). scoped_git_commit.py's own commit
# gate decides via direct `coordinator_core.session.claim_index` /
# `coordinator_core.session.liveness` module imports, never by invoking this
# CLI or parsing its stdout. Claude-klabauter owns liveness FACTS only; it does NOT
# decide chain-terminal disposition (see coordinator_core/session/
# stale_claims.py's module docstring BOUNDARY note).
#
# Subcommands (argv[1] selects; remaining argv forwarded to the mapped
# coordinator_core.session function):
#   claim-artifact <class> <basename> [baton_repo_root] -> claims.claim_artifact(...)
#   release-artifact <class> <basename> [baton_repo_root] -> claims.release_artifact(...)
#   clear-claim-if-dead <class> <basename> [baton_repo_root] -> claims.clear_claim_if_dead(...)
#     AC5 (docs/plans/2026-08-13-liveness-stops-conflating-dead-with-
#     elsewhere.md): for the three classed forms (handoff/memo/plan — NOT
#     the artifact/path-touch plane), a target that cannot be found is
#     self-diagnosing rather than silent. Before dispatching, the CLI
#     resolves the SAME claim directory claims.clear_claim_if_dead itself
#     resolves (core.sessions_dir — the identical public path-arithmetic,
#     never a second parser) and, if absent, emits a stderr note naming the
#     class/basename/path looked up and stating plainly this is NOT a
#     refusal, plus a hint when basename ends in ".md" (the claim key
#     carries no extension). Exit code is UNCHANGED (idempotent no-op ->
#     0, same as before) — the note is additive output only, distinct in
#     BOTH output and exit code from a live-holder refusal (which prints
#     "refusing to clear claim ... holder is live" and exits 1).
#   claim-plan <slug> [--for-execution] -> claims.claim_plan(slug, for_execution=...)
#     --for-execution is passed ONLY by /execute-plan Step 0 (DoE SKILL.md) —

#     docs/plans/2026-08-20-the-rungs-get-writers.md); the other two
#     production callers (coordinator-doc-new.py, wsc-coverage-gate-
#     runner.py cmd_claim_plan) never pass it and never flip status.

#       claimed_by/consumed_by frontmatter mirror.
#     exit 0   -> enumeration completed (0 or more matches printed) — an
#                 empty result is success, not failure, same contract as
#                 list-stale-claim-handoffs.

#       existing caller that parses only this first token/line sees no
#       difference. "live-elsewhere" (Review: staff-eng-review, C1's ripple)
#       is the exit-1 arm's basis carrying "harness-registry-elsewhere": the
#       session has no dir in THIS repo but the harness registry confirms it
#       live in another one — printing "dead" over that basis reproduced
#       this plan's own Problem statement in this CLI.
#     stdout line 2 (live/dead/live-elsewhere verdicts ONLY, i.e. exit 0 or

#       (AC7/AC8), never emitted
#       on the malformed-SID or transport-failure paths since those carry no
#       decided verdict to attach a basis to. A basis-derivation failure

#                 an infra/input error as "dead" is exactly the fail-open shape
#                 this exposure exists to close (see the stub's spec backlink).
#   who-claims-path <path> [cwd] -> claim_index.lookup([path], cwd=cwd) +

#     a DIFFERENT plane and a DIFFERENT question than
#     `list-claims-by-session` above (which reads the ARTIFACT-CLAIM RECORD
#     STORE -- each <class>-claims/<basename>/session_id file). A session
#     can hold zero artifact claims and still have touched a path; the two
#     subcommands legitimately disagree and neither is wrong. This is the
#     ONLY instrument exposing claim_index.lookup() -- previously it had
#     exactly one consumer in the whole repo (scoped_git_commit.py's commit
#     gate) and no CLI, so an EM hit by that gate's refusal had no way to

# dedicated code archive-stamp-cli uses — "the claude-klabauter engine could not be
# reached," never silently degraded to 0). A usage error (missing/unknown
# subcommand, wrong arity) exits 2. claim-artifact / release-artifact /
# clear-claim-if-dead additionally route through ``_call_claim_bool``, which
# catches the REQUIRED-arg ``ValueError`` those three claims.py functions

    session is still resident; (3) failing both, one of THREE distinct

    carries no name, which is what a pre-C1 record from an exited session
    renders as). Collapsing the first two into one marker, as this function
    did until 2026-09-01, made a DEGRADATION indistinguishable from a FACT:
    a caller cannot tell "re-check this against a workstream path" from
    "distrust this column entirely" when both print the same token. The

    identity the CLAIMANT claimed for itself at write time, not a live
    resolution performed now -- the whole reason C2 exists is that the sid
    beside it may no longer resolve to anything, and a name inherited from
    the same stale record is not proof it still does either. It is rendered
    with its age (``_format_claim_age``, following ``_holder_context``'s
    "held 33.8h" precedent) and an explicit staleness warning: the name may
    now belong to someone else, and a caller MUST verify liveness/identity
    before sending to it -- this function never claims present-tense
    reachability for a rung-1 answer. Rung 2's name IS a fresh live lookup,
    so it carries no age or staleness qualifier of its own, but it is still
    not a reachability claim: the caller decides, this function only names.

    Best-effort: an import failure, a raise from ``harness_registry.lookup``
    (which per its own docstring never raises, but this stays defensive
    should that contract ever change), or any other exception on the rung-2
    path degrades to rung 3 rather than propagating -- this column is
    additive display output on an already-decided claimant row and must
    never take down the row's ``sid``/``live|dead`` columns.
