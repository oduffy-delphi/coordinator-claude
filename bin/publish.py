"""coordinator/bin/publish.py — percolate publish driver: sync dispatch spine.

Native-Python port of `setup/publish.sh`'s main loop (DoE 16302166, 2026-07-21) — SYNC
DISPATCH LAYER ONLY. Resolves the 4-tier publish-target set (via
`coordinator/lib/percolate/targets.py`), then for each resolved target row
dispatches to the mode-appropriate copy engine:

  mirror / flat-mirror  -> imports `setup/publish_sync.py` in-process if the
                            resolved percolate root carries one, else this
                            repo's own `coordinator/lib/percolate/publish_sync.py`
                            (§ `_resolve_publish_sync_module_path`, AMENDED
                            2026-08-03 — DR-079 `26450311a`), and calls
                            `sync_mirror` / `sync_flat_mirror` directly (never
                            subprocesses it — this driver already runs in the
                            same Python process).
  manifest              -> `sync_manifest` below, a faithful port of the bash
                            copy loop (`setup/publish.sh`), using
                            `files_differ`/`bytes_differ` ported from
                            `setup/lib/percolate-gate.sh`.

Then writes the last-sync marker (`setup/percolate-state/<name>.lastsync`),
matching `setup/publish.sh` (Phase 5) — records the DESTINATION repo HEAD at
publish time (pre-commit anchor `/percolate` uses for inverse-drift detection).

GATES — the per-target gates bash runs before dispatch (`setup/
publish.sh`) are ported in `run_pre_sync_gates` and its
helpers: identity-file owner+mode pre-source check (once, at driver
startup — see `main`), live-install-clobber guard,
version-regression gate, version-consistency gate, and the non-fatal
machine-slug warn. Chunk C-W1d2 per
docs/plans/2026-07-21-percolate-python-port.md.

PERCOLATE-ENGINE CUTOVER (chunk C-W2) — the legacy pre-rsync/post-rsync hook
system (`setup/publish.sh`, which shelled the 14 `setup/
percolate-hooks/<target>/<hook_point>/*.sh` scripts) has been REPLACED, not
left as a no-op seam: `dispatch_percolate_pre_rsync` / `_post_rsync` /
`_inject` / `_pre_ci` call directly into the engine repo's
`coordinator_core.percolate` engine (`percolate_run.run_percolate` for the
3 phases + the separate `engine.run_inject_for_section` call) against
`setup/percolate-hooks/percolate-store.yaml`, resolved once per run via
`PercolateEngineContext` (see `main`). AC15 fail-closed (hard requirement):
an unreachable/unimportable engine, a bad/skewed store, an undeclared
target, or any phase-call raise/guard-failure aborts — this driver never
publishes a target's content unscrubbed. `--dry-run` skips engine-phase
dispatch entirely (the engine has no non-mutating preview mode; dispatching
it under `--dry-run` would mutate the destination, defeating the preview).
The 14 legacy hook `.sh` scripts + their `_lib/` are deleted (this chunk);
`setup/percolate-hooks/README.md` and the store's own header remain the
authoritative behavioral spec. Allowlist enforcement (`coordinator/lib/
percolate/allowlist.py`) IS wired — `run_pre_sync_gates` calls
`build_allowlisted_source` / `check_working_data_paths` /
`assert_allowlist_applied`, mode-agnostically, in the same position the bash
original runs them (`setup/publish.sh`, before the `case "$mode"`
dispatch at :1683). Fix: AC18(b), docs/plans/2026-07-21-percolate-python-port.md.

PERCOLATE_ROOT resolution (`resolve_percolate_root`) is a native-Python
in-process port of the bash bootstrap at `setup/publish.sh`: locate
`coordinator/bin/lib/cc_invoke.py`, call its `resolve_engine_root()`, then
import `coordinator_core.percolate.runtime_root.coordinator_percolate_runtime_root`
from the resolved engine repo checkout — the SAME underlying resolver the bash
original called via a `python3 -c` subprocess, just invoked directly since
this driver is already Python. Falls back to this repo's own root on any
failure, exactly mirroring the bash fallback's non-fatal degrade. This
resolution is the load-bearing fix for the one-level SOURCE_DIR offset
between the DoE-claude source layout (`coordinator/` IS the plugin root) and
the `~/.claude` live-install layout (`coordinator/` is one level below the
plugin root) — see `coordinator/docs/wiki/percolate-setup.md`.

Spec backlink: docs/plans/2026-06-22-portable-registry-resolved-publish-targets.md
Port: docs/plans/2026-07-21-percolate-python-port.md (chunk C-W1d1).

Negative-spec: this module performs no top-level side effects on import
(everything happens inside `main()`), and shells out to bash nowhere — the
percolate-engine dispatch calls `coordinator_core.percolate` in-process,
never via a subprocess or a bash trampoline (recipe §3 option b2, not b1).
It never syncs a target's UNRESTRICTED source tree once that target has
declared an allowlist — the FATAL post-condition (`assert_allowlist_applied`)
has no override and a failure there skips the target (mirrors the bash
`continue`), never downgrades to a warning. It never publishes a target
whose percolate-engine phase dispatch failed, raised, or returned a failing
guard result — AC15/AC8 fail-closed, never best-effort.

    the ONE misdiagnosable shape from every other import failure.

    A publish MIRROR is a destination, not a publisher: `setup/publish-targets.
    portable` field 7 carries explicit `!ops/percolate_*.py` negations, so a
    published tree deliberately carries no percolate engine. Because
    `resolve_engine_root()` walks up from the SCRIPT'S OWN location, running the
    mirror's copy of this driver resolves the engine root TO that mirror and
    dies on `No module named coordinator_core.ops.percolate_run` — which reads
    as "publish is broken fleet-wide" when the source repo's own copy publishes
    normally. That misreading survived 9 days as
    `state/bug-backlog/2026-08-11-klabauter-mirror-ships-the-ops-registry-
    287f6526da3a` and was escalated to a P1 outage that was never true.

    Detected structurally — the resolved root has no `coordinator_core/ops/
    percolate_run.py` on disk — rather than by matching the exception text, so a
    renamed module or a genuine ImportError inside a PRESENT percolate_run.py
    still falls through to the generic message with its real cause attached.

    Returns the generic text unchanged when `engine_root` is None (the root was
    never resolved: the failure happened at or before `require_engine_on_path`).

    Names `COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT`, never `CLAUDE_KLABAUTER_ROOT`, for two independent
    reasons — the first sufficient on its own (Review: code-reviewer, slice s2,
    2026-08-21, which found it):

    1. `resolve_engine_root` does not consult `CLAUDE_KLABAUTER_ROOT` at all. Post-C14 the
       dual-read window closed; `_ENGINE_ROOT_OLD_VAR` survives as a constant but
       no rung reads it. So the old advice was inert in the SOURCE tree too, with

       reads and conclude the refusal was lying.
    2. The publish transform rewrites repo-token identifiers including env-var
       NAMES, so a copy of this string living in the mirror renders as
       `CLAUDE_KLABAUTER_ROOT` — advising a reader to point the mirror's own root
       variable at a foreign checkout.

    `COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT` is rung 1 in both trees and carries no repo stem, so
    it is both actually-read and transform-stable. Do not restate reason 2 as "the
    mirror's copy is the only one that reaches this branch": the branch is
    reachable from any tree whose resolved root lacks a percolate engine, and
    `publish.py` is now denied from the mirror payload (though the copy published
    before that deny is stranded there — a withdrawn top-level file is never
    deleted at a mirror destination).

    "Same predicate" is the whole contract, and it is two things, both of which
    were previously false:

      1. The scoping params come off the `file-count-delta` GUARD ENTRY's own
         `params` — never the section's `file_surface`. `guards._walk_for_guard`
         reads the guard entry's params for `observed` (§ its docstring, and the
         store's own note on this entry: "`_walk_for_guard` reads scoping params
         off the guard ENTRY's own `params`, never the section's
         `file_surface`"), so an expected side derived from `file_surface`
         compares two different questions.
      2. The walk NARROWS to `include_extensions` (`_walk_for_guard` passes
         `narrow_to_include_extensions=True` unconditionally, deliberately —
         surface.py's 2026-08-05 admission-inversion is scoped to the engine's
         content-transform sweep, not to guard walks). Without narrowing,
         `surface.is_in_surface` admits everything not explicitly excluded, so
         the expected side counted non-`include_extensions` files the observed
         side never could — e.g. `.percolate-ignore`, which
         `coordinator/lib/percolate/allowlist.py::build_allowlisted_source`
         copies into the restricted staging tree unconditionally. That single
         dotfile was the standing `expected 28 (+/-0), got 27` failure on
         `coordinator-claude-toplevel-wiki`.

    This function therefore guarantees only what it can actually guarantee: the
    two sides of the delta ask the same question of two trees. It deliberately
    does NOT claim to mirror the engine's content-transform sweep — that claim
    is what was false, and the sweep's discovery call is un-narrowed by design.

    Returns `None` when `section` declares no `file-count-delta` guard entry: the
    count exists solely to feed that entry, and a section without one has nothing
    to feed. `None` propagates to `run_percolate(effective_source_count=...)`,
    which is already the "not supplied" value there. Same no-op-if-absent shape
    `dispatch_standalone_guards` uses for its own kind lookup — never a silent

    `_resolve_inject_src_placeholders`, which runs first) to point at its
    committed-ref shadow instead of the live working tree — docs/plans/
    2026-08-04-publish-from-a-committed-ref.md C4, AC6.

    `dispatch_percolate_inject` used to resolve `<claude-klabauter-content-root>` to
    `_REPO_ROOT` and stop there, so injected payload (today: 17 CI-harness
    files from `dist/mirror-native/claude-klabauter/.github`) bypassed
    `run_pre_sync_gates`' materialization entirely — the same class of hole
    C1/C1b closed for the un-allowlisted publish row, left open here.

    The covering unit is the materialized git TOPLEVEL (`_git_materialize_ref`),
    not the row's own contributing root: a naive "must resolve inside the
    row's contributing root, else fail" predicate REFUSES today's only real
    inject entry, since `dist/mirror-native/...` is not under
    `dist/klabauter-toplevel` (`claude-klabauter-publish-repo-toplevel`'s only
    contributing root). Instead, every non-exempt `src` is handed straight to
    `_git_materialize_ref`, which resolves *its own* containing git toplevel
    (materializing it on demand — memoized per `(toplevel, sha)` for the
    process lifetime, so this repo's own toplevel is almost always already
    cached from the row's own materialization) and returns the shadow path
    for that exact directory. `_git_materialize_ref` raises `GitMaterializeError`
    — never falls back to a live-tree copy — when `src` is in no git work
    tree at all; that is the only fail-loud condition here, not "outside the
    row's contributing root".

    `<coordinator-content-root>` USED to be exempt: it resolves into
    `percolate_root / "coordinator"`, DoE's own separate checkout, and entries
    inside it were passed through live-tree-sourced on the reasoning that
    materializing a sibling's checkout means reading a tree claude-klabauter does not
    own (the original plan's "Out of scope"). That exemption is removed — PM
    ruling, 2026-08-18. It shipped whatever bytes happened to be sitting in
    DoE's working tree, so an uncommitted local edit in a sibling checkout
    reached a published artifact with nothing recording where it came from,
    which is the exact hole AC6 exists to close and which C1/C1b closed for
    every other row. Negative spec: ownership governs WRITES, not reads —
    materializing reads a sibling's committed ref and writes only claude-klabauter's
    own shadow tree, so "a tree claude-klabauter does not own" was never a reason the
    bytes could go ungated. A DoE-checkout `src` that is uncommitted, or that
    sits in no git work tree at all, now fails the publish loud rather than
    silently publishing live bytes.

    `percolate_root=None` is the same no-op gate `_resolve_inject_src_placeholders`
    uses: a caller opting out of placeholder resolution (e.g. a unit test
    exercising `dispatch_percolate_inject` directly with no root) opts out of
    materialization too, since an unresolved `<placeholder>/...` string is not
    a real filesystem path to materialize.

    A resolved `src` that is neither absolute nor inside the DoE checkout —
    i.e. a relative, non-placeholder path — raises `GitMaterializeError`
    rather than falling through untouched (Review: code-reviewer Finding 4).
    AC6 requires injected content to be "materialized from the same ref...
    or the publish fails loud"; a bare `if src_path.is_absolute():` guard
    with no `else` left this shape neither materialized nor rejected. Not
    exercised by any store entry today (the one real inject entry resolves
    via `<claude-klabauter-content-root>`, always absolute), but the predicate must
    close this gap explicitly rather than leave it implicit.

    return contract (several unit tests exercise it directly). By the time

    for a toplevel distinct from the target's own contributing roots would

    locally here.

    On a `run_inject_for_section` raise, the newly-materialized toplevels
    (already on disk by then) are attached to the re-raised
    `EngineUnavailableError` as `.materialized_shadow_roots`, so the caller's
    `except` clause can still fold them into its cleanup accounting even
    though this function's normal return value is never reached.

    `visited_sink` (optional, § `dispatch_end_of_run_unscanned_published_check`
    fix): forwarded straight through to `engine.run_inject_for_section` as its own
    `visited_sink` — this call is an in-process Python call (not the JSON-RPC
    `percolate.run` op `dispatch_percolate_post_rsync` goes through), so the same

    Only the files the identity check actually executes are touched — not
    the other 15 files `.github/` ships (`run-all-checks.py`, the other 8
    checkers, allowlists, templates) — keeping this precondition's write
    footprint on a possibly-live destination tree minimal and exactly
    scoped to the drift class this closes.

    TWO files, not one, and the second is why this docstring changed. The
    checker `import`s its sibling `_repo.py` (file enumeration, the
    `SKIP_DIR_NAMES` exclusion set, gitignore fallback), so a meaningful part
    of "this run's own ruling" lives there rather than in the entry point.
    Refreshing only the entry point left the destination's stale `_repo.py`
    deciding WHICH FILES get scanned while the fresh script decided what
    counts as a finding — the precondition's own stated goal, unmet for half
    its logic.

    It also produced a DEADLOCK, which is the concrete reason this is a fix
    and not a tidy-up. `.github/` reaches the mirror through the toplevel row.
    When the identity check fails, that row does not land. So a correction
    made in `_repo.py` — the exclusion set being exactly where a
    false-positive fix belongs — could never take effect: the round it must
    fix is the round that refuses to ship it. Observed 2026-08-25 on
    `claude-klabauter`, where a `.percolate` exclusion added to `_repo.py`
    was live in source and inert at the destination across two consecutive
    rounds.

    Each file is refreshed independently and fail-open in the same shape as
    before: a missing sibling is reported in the currency note, never raised,
    so a destination that predates `_repo.py` is not turned into a hard
    failure by this precondition.

    Returns a short currency note for the failure message this call's
    caller builds: "refreshed from source" on a successful overwrite,
    "source not found in store" when `source_script` is None, or "refresh
    skipped, dest has no existing checker" when there is nothing to
    overwrite yet.

    `dispatch_percolate_post_rsync` unchanged (§ module docstring,
    rename-manifest reconciliation — a pre-ci guard enumerating files is just
    as vulnerable to a stale pre-rename path as a post-rsync guard). Raises
    `EngineUnavailableError` (AC15) on any engine failure or guard failure
    (AC8) — the caller must treat that as "abort this target, never publish".

    Also runs `<dest repo root>/.github/scripts/check-persona-names.py` (the
    mirror's own release-CI identity checker,
    `percolate_identity_check.run_identity_check`) here, after the phase's own
    `run_percolate` guards, but ONLY for the row whose `scan_dest` resolves to
    its OWN staging tree (`scan_dest == target.dest_dir`, below) — genuinely
    guard-before-mutate, since that staged content is about to be swapped
    into the real destination. Every other row's `scan_dest` is the mirror
    root itself, unstaged; re-scanning it once per such row cost ~28-33s per
    row for the byte-identical tree (state/audits/2026-08-16-percolate-round-
    first-measured-cost-distribution.md) — `dispatch_end_of_run_identity_check`
    scans that same tree once per repo root, unconditionally, after the round,
    so the per-row scan is dropped for those rows rather than duplicated. When
    it runs, it folds a failure into the SAME `_assert_no_guard_failures` list
    those guards populate rather than raising through a second, out-of-band
    channel — one design call, made deliberately:
    a target that fails EITHER the phase guards or the identity check aborts
    through the identical `EngineUnavailableError` path, so there is exactly
    ONE way a target aborts pre_ci, not two independently-catchable ones a
    future caller could accidentally handle differently. This is what closes
    the root cause this op exists for: the publish-side guard
    (`percolate_run.py::_registry_alternation_pattern`) derives its vocabulary
    from machine-local registry-repo slugs and is blind to a bare codename by
    construction, so running the mirror's own checker is what actually asks
    the question the mirror's release CI asks.

    The checker is resolved against the DESTINATION REPO ROOT
    (`_dest_repo_root(target.dest_dir)`), not `target.dest_dir` itself: for a
    row whose `dest_subdir` is non-empty (e.g. row 1 of the klabauter mirror,
    `dest_dir = <repo>/coordinator_core`), `.github/scripts/` only ever lands
    at the repo root, published by a SEPARATE toplevel row. Anchoring on
    `dest_dir` made every such row's identity check resolve to a path the
    checker could never occupy, so `run_identity_check` returned
    `skipped=True` every time and the guard-failure append (gated on `ran`)
    never fired — a structural blind spot, not a fluke (root-caused in
    `state/audits/2026-08-05-klabauter-scrub-and-gate-both-silent.md` § Q3).
    When no `.git` ancestor is found at all, this falls back to
    `target.dest_dir` unchanged (matches `_ensure_dest_ready`'s own fallback
    behaviour) and the skip warning below names that explicitly.

    `identity_dest_dir` (default `None`, meaning "use `target.dest_dir`"): the
    REAL destination path to anchor this check against, distinct from
    `target.dest_dir` when the caller is running this phase against a staged
    tree (§ `process_target`'s guard-before-mutate staging fix). The identity
    checker inspects a SIBLING toplevel row's already-published
    `.github/scripts/check-persona-names.py` at the real destination repo
    root — content this row's own staging never touches or owns — so this
    check is correct against the real tree regardless of whether the
    row-owned guard checks above ran staged or not; anchoring it at a
    throwaway staging path instead would make `_dest_repo_root` walk up from
    a directory outside any real repo and spuriously report `skipped=True`.

    A `skipped=True` result is no longer allowed to read as clean: it is
    always printed to stderr, loud, naming the path that was checked and
    why the row was skipped. It stays ADVISORY (does not fail the guard)
    because a legitimate ordering exists where this fires cleanly: a row
    with a non-empty `dest_subdir` can run before its sibling toplevel row
    has ever published `.github/` to a virgin destination, and the checker
    genuinely does not exist yet. Making it a hard failure would block that
    ordering permanently rather than the one publish where it is actually
    missing. What is NOT acceptable, and what this fix removes, is that skip
    being invisible — the whole failure class here was "a gate reporting
    nothing and being read as clean" (module docstring's root-cause note).

    after every row has synced — the fail-closed backstop the per-row
    `dispatch_percolate_pre_ci` check cannot be, by construction.

    Why the per-row leg alone is insufficient: `setup/publish-targets
    .portable` declares the `claude-klabauter` engine row (`dest_subdir`
    non-empty, the row that ships nearly the entire tree the checker scans)
    BEFORE `claude-klabauter-publish-repo-toplevel` (`dest_subdir` empty,
    the only row that ever publishes `.github/`). `main()` processes rows
    in declaration order, so on a full run into a wiped/virgin destination
    the engine row's own per-row check runs FIRST, finds no checker yet,
    and — correctly, per that function's own advisory-skip reasoning —
    does not fail the row. Nothing in the per-row path ever goes back and
    re-checks the engine row's payload once `.github/` DOES land later in
    the same run. That gap is exactly the failure this leg closes: a real
    release procedure ("prove the whole payload once, into a wiped
    destination, across every row") could complete green with the checker
    having never run against the row that matters most. The checker itself
    walks the WHOLE destination tree in one pass (not per-row content), so
    one run per repo root, AFTER every row has synced, covers every row's
    published bytes at once.

    Severity, deliberately asymmetric with the per-row leg:
      * `skipped=True` (checker not found) is FAIL-CLOSED on an unfiltered
        run (`target_filtered=False`) — by the time every declared row has
        synced, either the toplevel row published `.github/`, or this
        invocation had no business being called complete. Advisory here
        would silently reproduce the exact bug being fixed.
      * `skipped=True` under `target_filtered=True` (a `--target`-scoped
        single-row debug publish) stays ADVISORY (loud WARNING, no
        failure): `main()` skips every non-matching row (`if args.target
        and target.name != args.target: continue`), so a single-target
        invocation may legitimately never reach the toplevel row and never
        place `.github/` at all — that is not evidence of anything broken,
        it is evidence of what was asked for.
      * A nonzero exit code is a HARD failure UNCONDITIONALLY, filtered or
        not: if the checker ran, it already scanned real destination
        content and found a real finding. A `--target` scope narrows
        whether the checker was expected to exist; it never excuses acting
        on a finding it actually produced. This is what keeps a filtered
        debug publish from being "unfailable" per the task brief.

    Returns True iff every repo root passed (or was advisory-skipped);
    False iff any repo root hard-failed. Never raises `EngineUnavailableError`
    itself — the caller (`main()`) turns a False return into a nonzero
    process exit, since by this point in the run there is no single target
    left to attribute a fail-closed abort to; the failure is run-wide.

    Never called under `--dry-run` (see `main()`'s call site) — dry-run
    never mutates a destination, so there is nothing new for this leg to
    have found since the last real publish; firing it would report on
    stale, pre-existing destination state as if this run had produced it.

    C-round-scan HOIST (§ `dispatch_percolate_pre_ci`'s per-row scan
    reduced to the toplevel row only): the `_resolve_identity_checker_
    source_script` -> `_refresh_identity_checker_at_dest` PRECONDITION pair
    moves here, once per `repo_root`, immediately before `run_identity_
    check` — `dispatch_percolate_pre_ci`'s own per-row refresh, for the
    subdir rows that no longer scan, is gone with it, and this function
    performed NO refresh before this change; without moving it, a repo root
    whose toplevel row was skipped or failed would have this backstop scan
    under a STALE checker, reintroducing by the back door the exact "judged
    by a prior run's leftovers" defect the C6 comment in `dispatch_
    percolate_pre_ci` exists to close. `percolate_root` is threaded through
    for `_resolve_identity_checker_source_script`'s placeholder resolution;
    `None` (e.g. a caller with no store-backed target set) degrades to
    "nothing to refresh from", same as that function's own contract.

    `rows_by_repo_root`/`skipped_row_names` (optional, default `None`/
    unattributed) recover per-row attribution for a failing finding — §
    `_attribute_identity_findings` — since the dropped per-row scan used to
    give that away for free via which row's own check failed. Passing
    `None` for either degrades to the pre-attribution behaviour (raw
    `findings` text, no `[row: ...]` suffix).

    expected for a row whose `dest_subdir` is `rel_root`. Used by the
    pre-swap gate (§ chunk C1 brief AC4) to assert EXPECTED-SUBSET EQUALITY
    against what actually resolved in the row's own staging tree, never
    bare non-emptiness — four of six live rows (`docs/reference`,
    `docs/install`, `bin`, `scripts`) legitimately expect the empty set
    here (none of the three seed `rel_path`s fall under their
    `dest_subdir`), and an unconditional non-empty assertion would red
    every publish on the box.

    A FIFTH legitimately-empty case, distinct from the four `dest_subdir`-
    scoped ones above, applies only at `rel_root == ""`: a row whose staged
    payload is FLAT at its destination root — no `coordinator/` or
    `coordinator_core/` top-level directory at all — can never contain any
    of the three seed `rel_path`s, however complete its own publish is.
    `target.mode == "flat-mirror"` is NOT this discriminator on its own:
    `coordinator-claude`'s main `mode == "mirror"` row also lands flat at
    its destination root — its `source_map` (`plugin-source:project-
    claude-klabauter/coordinator=bin,lib`) renames `coordinator/bin` and `coordinator/
    lib` to the dest-relative top-level names `bin`/`lib`, so its own
    staged tree never contains a `coordinator/` directory either, same as
    the two genuinely `flat-mirror`-mode rows. Reconciled against the
    row's OWN STAGED layout instead (`staging_dir`, DESTINATION-LAYOUT
    RECONCILIATION over parsing `source_map`/`allowlist` syntax): each seed
    `rel_path`'s own top-level path component (`"coordinator"` for the two
    bare entries, `"coordinator_core"` for the dotted one) is checked for
    presence as a DIRECTORY under `staging_dir` — not the seed `rel_path`
    itself, which is exactly what the resolved leg (§
    `_function_gate_modules_and_search_paths_for_repo_root`) already
    checks. Testing the coarser directory-presence signal here, rather
    than re-running the same literal-file probe the resolved leg runs,
    keeps this an independent EXPECTED-SUBSET assertion instead of a
    tautology: a row whose `coordinator/` directory genuinely landed but
    is missing one seed file inside it (a real regression) still expects
    that entry and still fails the equality check, exactly as before.
    An EMPTY `staging_dir` is not a flat payload — it is a row that staged
    nothing. Directory-presence alone cannot tell those apart, and reading
    absence as "legitimately flat" would degrade this gate from "assert the
    payload landed" to "assert whatever landed is self-consistent" for
    exactly the total-staging-failure case it exists to catch: expected and
    resolved would both collapse to the empty set and the row would swap
    through. The narrowing therefore requires at least one staged entry;
    a row that produced nothing keeps the full all-three expectation and
    fails. A row that staged SOME of a nested payload but lost
    `coordinator/` specifically is still admitted here — no live row is
    nested at `rel_root == ""` (every row carrying `coordinator/` or
    `coordinator_core/` lands at a non-empty `dest_subdir`), so that case
    is currently held off by row configuration rather than by this code.

    `staging_dir=None` (a caller that predates this, or a `rel_root !=
    ""` call — the `coordinator_core` row's own mis-rooting check never
    reaches this branch at all) falls back to the pre-existing
    all-three-toplevel behavior, unchanged."""

    publish, or a row whose dest tree legitimately never ships

    `rel_root` (§ chunk C1 of docs/dispatch-briefs/2026-08-21-the-payload-

    `repo_root` is actually a per-row STAGING dir rather than a repo root —
    a `coordinator_core` row's staging dir holds `data_root.py` at its own
    root, not `coordinator_core/data_root.py`, so each in-scope seed
    entry's `rel_path` (§ `_function_gate_in_scope_seed_entries`) has
    `rel_root` stripped to get the STAGED relative path, and that staged
    path is what is actually probed for presence and searched for import
    under `repo_root`.

    `module_name` is adjusted the SAME way for a DOTTED entry whose name is
    itself the dotted form of `rel_path` (`coordinator_core.data_root`,
    resolved against `repo_root` as a genuine package root via the `""`
    search path) — the same `rel_root` prefix, dotted, is stripped from
    the module name so the STAGED import target matches the STAGED file
    location (`coordinator_core.data_root` -> `data_root` when `rel_root`
    is `coordinator_core`, since the staged tree has no `coordinator_core/`
    directory of its own to import through). A BARE entry
    (`coordinator_registry`, `coordinator_data_root` — resolved via their
    own containing directory on `PYTHONPATH`, never dotted against the
    root) is untouched either way: its own `search_dir` is already
    computed from the staged `rel_path`, so no name rewrite is needed for
    it to keep resolving correctly.

    `search_paths` always includes `""` (resolves to `repo_root` itself in
    `run_function_gate`, § that function's `prepend` derivation) so a
    package-rooted dotted import resolves against the repo root, plus each
    present seed entry's own containing directory (`coordinator/bin/lib`

    path itself is).

    alone -- green on a dev box that happens to have one, silently unproven
    for an OSS user who does not. Anchoring this rung at anything ambient
    would revert BLOCKER-2 with extra steps. The fixture staged here is
    synthetic and minimal on purpose, and is torn down when this context
    exits.

    `docs/install/agent-install-manifest.json` declares `coordinator-claude`
    as `direct_deps[0]` with `severity: "hard"` -- claude-klabauter's own published
    install contract already states a coordinator-claude install (which
    ships this manifest) is a hard prerequisite. Staging a resolvable
    manifest here asserts exactly that shipped contract: the gate proves the
    payload imports cleanly GIVEN a conformant manifest at the plugin root,
    not that one happens to be sitting on whichever box runs the publish.

    ENUMERATION (2026-08-10, klabauter-mirror gate closure) -- which OTHER
    plugin-install-provided data dirs the two end-of-run gates can demand at
    STARTUP, derived from code rather than from iterating live-run failures:

      - FUNCTION gate: imports exactly the three `_FUNCTION_GATE_SEED_
        MODULES` (`coordinator_registry`, `coordinator_data_root`,
        `coordinator_core.data_root`). All three resolve `data_root()`
        LAZILY, inside a function body, never at import time (see
        `coordinator_data_root.py`'s own "Import-time purity" negative-
        spec) -- so a bare import demands nothing beyond the manifest
        already staged above.

      - ENTRYPOINT gate: runs `--help` for every entry `enumerate_gate_
        entrypoints()` returns, which is BARE (extensionless) files under
        `coordinator/bin` and `coordinator/scripts` only -- `.py`-suffixed
        CLIs (e.g. `sync-cockpit-contract.py`, `verify-schema-registry-
        sync.py`, `fan-out-integrator.py`, `doctor-catalog-gen.py`, `gen-
        claude-doe-shim.py`) are explicitly out of that gate's scan scope
        (§ `enumerate_gate_entrypoints` docstring), so whatever data dirs
        THEY touch at startup is irrelevant here even though several of
        them also call `coordinator_data_root.data_root()`. A source sweep
        of all 72 bare entrypoints under those two scan roots (`grep` for
        `data_root`/`coordinator_data_root` across every one, verified
        2026-08-10) found exactly ONE that references it at all:
        `coordinator/bin/snippet-registry`, whose `_resolve_plugin_root()`
        calls `data_root("snippets")` unconditionally in `main()`, before
        any subcommand (including an unrecognized `--help`) is dispatched.
        No other bare entrypoint imports or calls it, directly or
        transitively -- the set is therefore CLOSED, not open-ended: exactly
        one additional dir, "snippets", beyond the manifest's own "schemas".

    PRINCIPLE: this fixture stages what the DECLARED HARD DEPENDENCY
    (coordinator-claude, `agent-install-manifest.json` `direct_deps[0]`)
    provides and what the SHIPPED, GATE-SCANNED entrypoints actually consume
    at process startup -- nothing more. `snippets/registry.toml` is staged
    with the minimal valid shape `coordinator_core.snippet_sync.registry.
    load_registry()` accepts (`schema_version = 1`, no `[snippet.*]` rows)
    -- enough for `snippet-registry` to resolve its data dir and parse the
    registry without crashing; it still exits 1 on `--help` (an
    unrecognized subcommand, printed via its own usage block) exactly like
    the six other CLIs the 2026-08-10 C6 sweep already classified this way,
    which is `_USAGE_NONZERO_ENTRYPOINTS`' concern, not this fixture's.

def dispatch_end_of_run_function_gate(

    *,
    target_filtered: bool,
) -> bool:
    """FUNCTION gate (chunk C4B, wiring C4's `run_function_gate` into the
    driver — AC3): for each distinct destination repo root this
    invocation's rows resolve to, import the seed module set (§
    `_FUNCTION_GATE_SEED_MODULES`) that is actually present in the WRITTEN
    payload, in a hermetic subprocess whose environment carries none of
    the private registry keys or env vars, and whose HOME/USERPROFILE/
    CLAUDE_HOME are anchored to a fresh, isolated, empty temp directory
    rather than the real ones (`hermetic_gate_env`, C4/BLOCKER-2, same
    engine module — never hand-rolled here). A payload that cannot import
    its own entrypoint modules fails the publish.

    ALSO runs `engine_claude_klabauter.run_parse_sweep` (§ chunk C4C) over every `.py`
    file in the same repo root, BEFORE the seed-module import check, and
    independently of whether the seed set has anything present to gate
    (import-reachability and total-parse coverage are orthogonal — see
    `run_parse_sweep`'s own docstring for why neither leg subsumes the
    other). A repo root can fail on the parse sweep alone even when every
    seed module (if any are present) imports cleanly.

    Run ONCE per distinct destination repo root (same shape as
    `dispatch_end_of_run_identity_check` /
    `..._install_doc_payload_check`), after every row has synced — the
    gate needs the FULLY ASSEMBLED tree, same reason those two legs are
    end-of-run rather than per-row.

    SEVERITY — a deliberate departure from `dispatch_end_of_run_
    identity_check`/`..._install_doc_payload_check`'s advisory-under-
    `--target` split, and the judgement call this chunk's brief asks to be
    stated explicitly: **this leg is FAIL-HARD unconditionally, filtered
    or not.** Unlike those two legs, there is no cross-row "a sibling row
    hasn't synced yet" dependency for a single module's own importability
    — `_function_gate_modules_and_search_paths_for_repo_root` already
    scopes the gate down to modules the payload actually shipped, so
    `target_filtered` narrows WHICH modules are even considered (exactly
    like `dispatch_end_of_run_unscanned_published_check`'s own
    `target_filtered` docstring note), never whether a module that WAS
    shipped and does NOT import is excused. AC3 reads "the publish
    pipeline fails when the payload cannot import its own entrypoint
    modules" — an advisory-only gate here would reproduce the exact "a
    callable nobody enforces" gap this chunk exists to close (the leak
    gate's blind spot survived on advisory reporting alone; see this
    chunk's own brief). `target_filtered` is still accepted, for call-site
    symmetry with the other three legs and because a future caller may
    want it, but it does not change severity in this function's body —
    documented explicitly rather than silently unused.

    Returns True iff every repo root's present seed modules all imported
    cleanly; False iff any present module failed to import or the gate
    itself could not run. Never raises — same reporting contract as the
    other three end-of-run legs. Never called under `--dry-run` (same
    reason as the other three; see `dispatch_end_of_run_identity_check`'s
    docstring and `main`'s dry-run early return).

    WHAT THIS GATE ACTUALLY ASSERTS: the published payload imports cleanly
    GIVEN a conformant `coordinator-registry.manifest.json` at the plugin
    root, and nothing else from the ambient environment. It is narrower than
    "the payload works" -- manifest-SCHEMA conformance (are the fields
    right, do the doc types resolve, etc.) remains DoE-claude's own
    contract, tested on their side; this gate only proves importability
    given a manifest shaped enough for `coordinator_registry`'s bootstrap to
    accept.

    The "resolvable manifest" rung is a SYNTHETIC, minimal fixture staged
    per-call by `_synthetic_registry_manifest_overrides` and injected via
    `hermetic_gate_env`'s own `overrides` parameter -- the exact seam its
    docstring names as the intended consumer, and the same construction
    `test_gate_fires_hermetically_on_synthetic_manifest_fixture`
    (`coordinator_core/percolate/tests/test_function_gate.py`) builds by
    hand. It is deliberately NEVER the ambient dev-box install, a real
    installed plugin, or DoE-claude's own tree: `publish.py` BLOCKER-2
    stripped ambient `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`/`CLAUDE_HOME` passthrough
    precisely because that let this gate evaluate the payload against the
    PUBLISHING BOX'S OWN coordinator-claude install rather than the payload
    alone -- green on a dev box that happens to have one, silently unproven
    for an OSS user who does not. Anchoring the manifest rung at anything
    ambient reverts BLOCKER-2 with extra steps; do not "simplify" this into
    an ambient lookup. `docs/install/agent-install-manifest.json` names
    `coordinator-claude` as `direct_deps[0]` with `severity: "hard"`, so
    requiring a resolvable manifest here asserts exactly the shipped install
    contract, not something stricter or looser than it.

    `dispatch_end_of_run_function_gate` runs END-OF-RUN, run PER-ROW
    against the STAGED tree in `process_target`, immediately before
    `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest` — a failure here refuses the swap for
    THIS row, before it ever overwrites the destination. Additive to the
    end-of-run leg, which remains the cross-root backstop (a mis-rooting
    bug in a future repo-root shape this leg does not cover).

    `staging_dir` is NOT a repo root — it is `target.dest_dir`'s own
    subtree in isolation (§ `_create_publish_staging_dir`), rooted at
    whatever `_dest_prefix_for(target.dest_dir)` (the row's `dest_subdir`)
    is beneath the real destination repo root. The `coordinator_core` row
    stages `data_root.py` at ITS OWN root, not at
    `coordinator_core/data_root.py` — feeding `staging_dir` through the
    end-of-run gate's repo-root-shaped probe unmodified misses all three
    `_FUNCTION_GATE_SEED_MODULES` entries (`modules == []`), silently
    degrading to parse-sweep-only on the one row that matters (§ this
    chunk's own brief for the concrete miss). `rel_root` (derived here via
    `_dest_prefix_for`) corrects both the seed-presence probe and the
    search-path derivation for that offset (§
    `_function_gate_modules_and_search_paths_for_repo_root`).

    AC4 — EXPECTED-SUBSET EQUALITY, never bare non-emptiness:
    `_function_gate_expected_seed_rel_paths_for_rel_root` derives which
    seed entries (by `rel_path` identity) THIS row's `rel_root` is even in
    scope for; asserting the resolved `rel_path` set against that expected
    set (not merely "resolved is non-empty") is what keeps the four rows
    that legitimately ship none of
    the three seed modules (`docs/reference`, `docs/install`, `bin`,
    `scripts`) green while still catching the `coordinator_core` row's own
    mis-rooting (an unconditional non-empty assertion would red every
    publish on the box; a bare `continue`-on-empty would silently pass a
    row whose probe missed for the wrong reason).

    A row whose staged payload is flat at `rel_root == ""` — no top-level
    `coordinator/`/`coordinator_core/` directory in `staging_dir` at all —
    is a SIXTH legitimately-empty case alongside the four `dest_subdir`-
    scoped ones: its destination can never contain any of the three seed
    entries there, however complete the row's own publish is (§
    `_function_gate_expected_seed_rel_paths_for_rel_root`'s own docstring,
    which reconciles against `staging_dir`'s OWN layout rather than
    `target.mode` — a `mode == "mirror"` row can land just as flat as a
    `mode == "flat-mirror"` one, via its own `source_map`/allowlist
    contribution). `staging_dir` is passed through for this row alone —
    it does not affect the `coordinator_core` row's own mis-rooting check
    above, which stays keyed on `rel_root` alone (`staging_dir` is a no-op
    for any nonempty `rel_root` call, § that function's own docstring).

    Preconditions the end-of-run caller gets for free via its own
    `not dry_run` narrowing, and this per-row caller must establish itself
    (§ chunk brief item 1): `engine_ctx.engine_claude_klabauter` is asserted
    non-`None` directly here — `process_target` only reaches this call
    inside its own `not dry_run and engine_ctx.engine_claude_klabauter is not None
    and engine_ctx.store is not None` branch (the same condition that
    creates `staging_dir` in the first place), so the assert below holds by
    construction for TODAY'S only caller. The `assert` is the actual safety
    net; this paragraph describes `process_target`'s current narrowing, not
    a property a future caller inherits for free.

    Returns True iff the resolved module set exactly equals the expected
    subset for this row's `rel_root` AND every resolved module (if any)

    (`equivalence_map=` surviving a dropped parameter on the callee 11
    minutes before the caller caught up).

    Lands in the SAME pre-swap slot `dispatch_preswap_function_gate`
    occupies (chunk C1), additive to it -- neither replaces the other, and
    both run against the fully-assembled `staging_dir` immediately before
    `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest`.

    `rel_root` (`_dest_prefix_for(target.dest_dir)`) is threaded through so
    this row's own module-prefix vocabulary matches what a genuine repo
    root would produce (§ `payload_parity.build_first_party_import_index`)
    -- the SAME row-shape correction C1 makes for the function gate; see

    `changed_files` is `_report_published_diff`'s own `NEW:`/`UPDATE:`
    rel-path set (staging_dir-relative), reused rather than recomputed --
    see that function's docstring for why re-deriving it here would cost a

    defect fix -- the writer, `_update_token_index_from_delta`, always keys
    and locates the index at `_manifest_root`, a repo root, never a row's
    own `dest_dir`); the prescreen seeks into it instead of reading every

    degrades to the full scan and today's answer rather than to "no
    candidates" (§ `payload_parity :: _files_referencing_needles`, AC5).
    `token_index_root` is threaded alongside it so the reader and writer
    agree on the SAME key space (repo-root-relative) rather than the reader
    stripping `rel_root` back down to a `dest_dir`-relative key the writer
    never produced.

    brief and this module's own `dispatch_end_of_run_function_gate`
    docstring for why the ambient environment must never reach a gate
    subprocess).

    This is a DIFFERENT, complementary check from `dispatch_end_of_run_
    function_gate` above: that leg proves three seed modules IMPORT; this
    leg proves each shipped entrypoint actually STARTS when invoked as a
    process, the defect class `run_entrypoint_gate`'s own module-level
    comment names (a broken join, or a `__main__`-guarded code path, neither

    "do not delete or disable `run_function_gate`... both legs run").

    Dispatches under this chunk's derived worker cap (`engine_claude_klabauter.
    derive_worker_cap()`, this repo's real two-term `min(physical_cores/2,
    usable_RAM_GB*1024/150MB)` formula, § CLAUDE.md) and aggregate wall-clock

    -- same "needs the fully assembled tree" reasoning as the other
    end-of-run legs (§ `dispatch_end_of_run_function_gate`'s own docstring).

    TIMEOUTS (§ chunk C2 AC3) are reported SEPARATELY from `result.failures`
    and never flip `ok` on their own -- `run_entrypoint_gate`'s `timed_out`
    field distinguishes "this box was busy" from "this CLI is broken" at
    classification time. This leg still prints the timeout count
    unconditionally (never suppressible) and escalates to an explicit
    unproven-payload warning when the timeout share crosses
    `_ENTRYPOINT_GATE_TIMEOUT_SHARE_WARN_FLOOR`, or on ANY timeout for an
    unfiltered (`target_filtered=False`) release-shaped run -- a sweep
    where every entrypoint times out must never read as a quiet green.

    SEVERITY -- FAIL-HARD unconditionally, filtered or not, same judgement
    call as `dispatch_end_of_run_function_gate` for the same reason: a
    non-starting entrypoint that WAS shipped in this row's payload has no
    cross-row "sibling hasn't synced yet" excuse. `target_filtered` is
    accepted for call-site symmetry only and does not change severity here.

    Returns True iff every repo root's gated entrypoints all started cleanly
    (or were on the waiver/usage-nonzero lists, § `run_entrypoint_gate`'s own
    three-way classification); False iff any failed to start, or the gate
    itself could not run. Never raises -- same reporting contract as the
    other end-of-run legs. Never called under `--dry-run`.

    `changed_only` (§ chunk C5, AC11): this function's own default stays
    False (`subset=None`, the full sweep every pre-existing call site got
    before this parameter existed) — it is the neutral primitive default,
    not a policy choice. The POLICY choice lives at the CLI layer: PM
    ruling, 2026-08-15, the entrypoint gate runs --changed-only or --delta,
    never a full sweep, so `publish.py`'s own `--changed-only` CLI flag now
    defaults ON and threads `True` here on a default invocation; `--full-
    sweep` is the CLI's opt-out. When True, `changed_files_by_repo_root`
    (§ docs/plans/2026-08-16-percolate-round-timing-and-changed-only.md

    `find_functional_identifier_output_drift_in_tree`
    (`coordinator_core/percolate/store.py`) into the end-of-run gate sequence
    (Review: staff-eng MAJOR-2, `state/review-findings/2026-08-08-codename-
    free-partitioned/slice-D-drift-store.md`, deferred until the concurrent
    drift-store repair landed). Before this leg, nothing called that
    function outside its own tests/docstrings — a scrub that renamed a wire
    identifier shipped exactly as before, silently.

    Run PER ROW (`row_sections`, the same `(target, section)` accumulator
    `dispatch_end_of_run_unscanned_published_check` consumes), never deduped
    by destination repo root like the other three legs — `resolved_section`
    and `source_dir` are per-row properties, so there is no shared repo-root
    key to dedup comparisons on; two rows sharing a destination repo root can
    still have distinct sources and distinct resolved sections.

    For each row, diffs `target.source_dir` against `target.dest_dir` with
    `resolved_section=section` supplied — omitting it makes the check see
    the raw, unfiltered pre-C10 pair stream (§ that function's own
    docstring). `dest_publish_time` is deliberately never supplied: that
    branch forks one `git log` per file (~1600 files in `coordinator_core`
    alone) and is what killed two prior measurement attempts on this
    machine's shared, heavily-loaded tree; with `resolved_section` supplied
    and no cutoff, the walk spawns zero subprocesses (measured directly by
    the sidecar review).

    By the time this end-of-run leg runs (after every row has synced and
    swapped), `target.dest_dir` IS the freshly published payload this run
    just wrote, not a stale pre-run snapshot — same "read the staged payload
    it is about to write, not the stale destination" requirement the other
    end-of-run legs already satisfy by running after the full row loop.

    The ratchet baseline (`functional-identifier-output-drift-baseline.txt`)
    is loaded ONCE, up front, and is currently, deliberately, EMPTY — empty
    means "detect everything," never "gate disabled" (no "empty means skip"
    short-circuit exists here or should be added; the baseline identity is
    the bare `(source_token, published_token)` pair, mirroring
    `_check_functional_identifier_output_not_drifted`'s own ratchet check).
    A pair present in the baseline is grandfathered; one that is not fails
    this leg.

    SEVERITY — FAIL-HARD unconditionally, same judgement call as
    `dispatch_end_of_run_function_gate` (`target_filtered` accepted for
    call-site symmetry only; a row's own source-vs-dest comparison has no
    cross-row "sibling hasn't synced yet" dependency to legitimately degrade
    under `--target`).

    Returns True iff every row's comparison found no un-baselined drift;
    False otherwise. Never raises — same reporting contract as the other
    end-of-run legs. Never called under `--dry-run` (same reason as the
    other legs).

    """Return the EXPLICIT install-doc set `check_tree` should scan under
    `repo_root` — every top-level `.md` the published tree actually ships,
    MINUS the changelog class.

    Why an explicit set at all: `check-install-doc-payload.py`'s
    `DEFAULT_DOC_GLOB = "*.md"` sweeps every top-level `.md`, and a full run
    against the real payload returned 71 findings — 69 in `CHANGELOG.md`, 2 in
    `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and ZERO in any install doc. The gate was reporting almost
    entirely on a document class it has no business gating.

    Why the CHANGELOG class specifically, and ONLY it: a changelog is the one
    document class in which a reference to a since-retired filename is CORRECT.
    An entry reading "`bin/cruft-sweep.sh` (mechanical) + ..." was TRUE of the
    release it describes; the file's later retirement does not falsify the
    historical record, and "fixing" such an entry to point at today's path
    rewrites history into something that never shipped. De-linkifying them to
    silence the checker is worse still — it degrades published prose to appease a
    gate (DoE tried exactly that and reverted it). An install doc says "here is
    how to install"; a changelog says "here is how we used to install", and only
    the former is a claim about the tree as published.

    Everything else the tree ships is KEPT, including the policy docs that
    currently return zero findings — the set is "all shipped top-level `.md`
    minus one named class", never a hand-maintained allowlist. Two reasons: the
    two published mirrors do not ship the same doc set (only one has an
    `INSTALL.md`), so an allowlist would need per-repo knowledge and would go
    stale the moment a doc is added; and an allowlist silently drops any doc
    class nobody remembered to list, which is the failure mode of the gate this
    replaces, one file over.

    `CONTRIBUTING.md` is deliberately IN the set despite being the other doc
    named in the 71: it carries real install-relevant payload and this gate has
    already caught a GENUINE stale pointer in it (`lib/install-substrate.sh`,
    retired to `install-substrate.py`). It documents how to run the tree as it
    is NOW, not as it once was — the changelog argument does not reach it.

    Negative-spec: do NOT "helpfully" widen this back to a bare `*.md` glob or to
    `--recursive`. The narrowing is the fix, and its whole content is the one
    named exclusion above.

    """Run `check_install_doc_payload.check_tree()` ONCE per distinct
    destination repo root touched by this `main()` invocation, after every

    The doc set is passed EXPLICITLY (§ `_install_doc_paths_for_repo_root`),
    never left to the checker's `DEFAULT_DOC_GLOB = "*.md"`: that default swept
    the changelog, the one document class in which a reference to a since-
    retired path is correct rather than stale, and produced 69 of a full run's
    71 findings from it.

    Why not per-row (and why not "both"): `check-install-doc-payload.py`'s
    own author found, running it live against `dist/klabauter-toplevel`,
    that `CONTRIBUTING.md` references `.github/scripts/run-all-checks.py`,
    a file that ships from the SIBLING toplevel row, not the row whose
    tree they were checking (see that module's docstring "WIRING" section
    and its sidecar,
    state/subagent-share/e4ae702d-32fa-4954-96d0-63fcfe810f9b/
    coordinatorexecutor-cad6ccb4.md). A per-row call sees only that row's
    slice of the destination mid-run — before every sibling row has synced
    — so it cannot distinguish a real broken doc reference from a
    reference that is merely satisfied by a row that hasn't run yet. Unlike
    the identity checker (whose "not found yet" case at least has an
    explicit `skipped` signal to make advisory), `check_tree()` has no such
    signal: a finding just IS a finding, so a per-row call would either
    have to swallow every cross-row reference as always-advisory (which
    defeats the gate — it would never fail anything) or produce exactly
    the false positives observed live. End-of-run, after every declared
    row has synced, sees the FULLY ASSEMBLED tree the doc's reader will
    actually get — the question this gate exists to ask only has a
    stable answer at that point.

    Severity mirrors `dispatch_end_of_run_identity_check`'s split for the
    same reason: `main()` skips every row not matching `--target`
    (`if args.target and target.name != args.target: continue`), so a
    single-target debug publish may never place a sibling row's file a doc
    references — that is not evidence of a broken doc, it is evidence of a
    partial publish. Findings are therefore ADVISORY (loud WARNING, no
    failure) under `target_filtered=True`, and a HARD failure on an
    unfiltered run, where every row was supposed to have synced.

    Returns True iff every repo root came back clean (or was
    advisory-warned); False iff any repo root hard-failed. Never raises —
    same reporting contract as `dispatch_end_of_run_identity_check`, and
    never called under `--dry-run` for the same reason (see that
    function's docstring; `main()`'s dry-run early return covers both
    end-of-run legs identically).

    """Run `directive_cli_arity.argv_parity_report` ONCE per distinct

    (docs/plans/2026-08-15-bind-the-klabauter-publish-rows-into-a-parity-
    group.md, chunk C4, AC4/AC6).

    The report runs against the ASSEMBLED DESTINATION tree — the mirror as
    a consumer will actually execute it, `repo_root/coordinator_core` paired
    against `repo_root/coordinator/bin` — never against this repo. The
    mirror's layout preserves both subtrees unchanged from source, so
    `resolve_bin_script` resolves against the destination root with no path
    rewriting (verified non-issue, recorded per this chunk's own brief so a
    future reader does not have to rediscover it).

    BASELINE-RELATIVE, same subset semantics as C2's
    `test_engine_cli_argv_parity.py`: the gate fails ONLY on an
    `unaccepted`/`undeclared_required` token that is NOT already present in
    the committed baseline (`_load_source_argv_parity_baseline_keys`), i.e.
    NEW skew introduced since that baseline was pinned — never on the
    pre-existing red set the baseline enumerates. Both this gate and C2's
    test consume the same oracle over the same corpus, so they share the
    same reasoning the plan's own § Anti-scope gives for AC2: enumerate a
    pre-existing defect in the baseline rather than gate on it being empty.
    One genuine pre-existing skew survives in this repo as of authoring
    time (`merge_assemble` d4 -> `merge-gate-and-pr pr-body`, missing
    required `--ship-verdict`/`--release-notes`; filed separately,
    `state/bug-backlog/2026-08-15-merge-assemble-d4-invokes-merge-gate-and-
    0de925b03e8d.yaml`, NOT this gate's to fix) — a gate with the OLD
    empty-baseline semantics would fail every publish round on that one
    known defect, which is a gate operators learn to ignore. A pairing
    listed in the baseline is a KNOWN defect, not an endorsed one.

    If the baseline cannot be loaded (missing, unreadable, malformed —
    `_load_source_argv_parity_baseline_keys` returns `None`), this gate
    FAILS with that reason stated, for every repo root, before comparing
    anything — a gate that cannot find its baseline and silently passes is
    worse than no gate at all.

    A pairing failing on EITHER `unaccepted` (an emitted flag the target
    parser does not declare) OR `undeclared_required` (a declared-required
    flag/subcommand the emitter does not emit) is a candidate finding — the
    second direction is exactly the hazard the klabauter parser-before-
    emitter reorder (§ `_assert_klabauter_parity_group_ordering`) exists to
    guard against for non-additive parser changes, so a gate blind to it
    could not detect what that reorder was built to catch. `unresolved`
    pairings are never treated as failures nor as clean passes — they are
    outside what static AST reading could prove for this round and are
    silently excluded from the verdict, matching C1's `argv_parity_report`
    contract (`unresolved` is never `clean`, but this gate has no stronger
    claim to make about a pairing it cannot read) and matching C2's own
    baseline, which never keys an `unresolved` pairing by token.

    SEVERITY — FAIL-HARD UNCONDITIONALLY, not degraded under `--target`,
    unlike `dispatch_end_of_run_identity_check` /
    `..._install_doc_payload_check`'s advisory-under-`--target` split. A
    prior-art check across this module's own end-of-run legs found no
    universal rule either way: some carry "advisory under --target"
    language (the two named above), others (`dispatch_end_of_run_function_
    gate`, `dispatch_end_of_run_entrypoint_gate`) do not — the choice is
    case-by-case per gate, not governed by settled doctrine, and THIS
    sentence is the only place a future reader can learn why THIS gate
    chose fail-hard. The reason: a `--target` subset publish is precisely
    how a partial mirror gets constructed — "a sibling row hasn't synced
    yet, so the destination looks skewed" is the exact condition this gate
    exists to detect, never an excuse to suppress detecting it. Degrading
    it under `--target` would blind the gate on the one invocation shape
    most likely to produce the skew it is built to catch. The baseline
    relaxation above is a DIFFERENT axis (which skew counts at all) and
    does not weaken this one (whether `--target` softens a real finding —
    it never does).

    Never short-circuits on failure and is never short-circuited by a
    sibling leg's failure — `main()` calls every end-of-run leg
    unconditionally (2026-08-14 aggregate-instead-of-abort fix) so one round
    surfaces every defect class instead of one at a time.

    HAZARD — false positive on operator-local mirror edits: this gate reads
    the destination WORKING TREE, which this plan's own § Anti-scope
    records as carrying ~28 uncommitted modifications under
    `coordinator_core/` today, unrelated to this run's publish.
    `2026-08-04-publish-from-a-committed-ref.md` holds the SOURCE side of a
    publish still (reads a committed ref, not the live source tree) — it
    says nothing about the DESTINATION working tree, which this gate reads
    as-is. A pairing can therefore fail on a file this round never
    published, reading as a false FATAL at exit 2 on an otherwise-clean
    round. To make that diagnosable rather than re-discovered, every
    reported pairing's `module` path is tagged, in the printed failure, as
    either `published-by-this-round` (present under one of `repo_roots`'
    corresponding row's known allowlisted surface for this run) or
    `destination-only` (present in the destination tree but not attributable
    to anything this invocation just wrote) — see `_argv_parity_pairing_origin`.

    Returns True iff every repo root's resolvable pairings carry no NEW
    skew beyond the baseline; False iff any repo root has a new
    `unaccepted`/`undeclared_required` finding, the report itself could not
    be produced, the baseline itself could not be loaded, or a repo root is
    not a directory. Never raises — same reporting contract as the other
    end-of-run legs. Never called under `--dry-run`: `main()`'s dry-run
    early return covers every end-of-run leg identically, and a preview run
    mutates no destination for this gate to meaningfully assess.

    A `repo_root` that is not a directory FAILS this gate rather than being
    silently skipped: every `repo_root` passed in is a distinct destination
    this round is expected to have assembled, so a missing/non-directory
    root means the round did not actually land what it claims to have
    landed there (e.g. a race with a concurrent process on this box) — the
    exact permissive-degradation shape this gate's baseline-load path
    already refuses (see above).

    the wiring layer, once per end-of-run dispatch.

    The second set exists so the caller can tell "declared, and known not
    to carry the engine" (eligible for NOT-APPLICABLE) apart from "not a
    recognised declared destination at all" (a repo_root this function has
    no opinion on — e.g. a synthetic scratch tree in a test, or any future
    caller of the gate with a destination this ledger has never heard of).
    Only the former is NOT-APPLICABLE; the latter falls back to the SAME

    omits `coordinator_core_in_declared_scope` entirely (`True` — keep

    "declared out of scope" merely because it never appeared in the

    Reuses the exact unfiltered-load shape already established at this
    file's own `_required_pathspec_for` (`load_targets(setup_dir,
    target_filter="", err=io.StringIO())`) — `err=io.StringIO()` is
    load-bearing there and here alike: `main()`'s own `load_targets` call
    already printed shadow-collision diagnostics to stderr once this run,

    Deliberately does NOT swallow `TargetsError` the way `_required_

    core is not in this destination's declared scope" -> NOT-APPLICABLE ->
    a failure to load the targets file waiving the gate on itself, the same
    fail-open shape as the exemption bug this whole change exists to close.
    A `TargetsError` here is INCOMPLETE (no claim could be determined), so
    it is left to propagate; the caller catches it and reports the round as
    unable to determine declared scope rather than reading absence as
    not-applicable.

    """END-OF-RUN leg (docs/plans/2026-08-28-a-dropped-module-must-not-
    leave-its-test-behind.md, chunk C3): wires C2's `run_assembled_mirror_
    gate` (`coordinator/lib/percolate/assembled_mirror_gate.py`) into the
    driver, once per distinct destination repo root, over the SAME
    `deduped_roots` / `rows_by_repo_root` shape every sibling end-of-run leg
    in this module already uses (`dispatch_end_of_run_argv_parity_gate`,
    `dispatch_end_of_run_identity_check`, `dispatch_end_of_run_function_
    gate`) — see this file's own C4 (docs/plans/2026-08-15-bind-the-
    klabauter-publish-rows-into-a-parity-group.md) precedent for why a
    per-mirror question is answered once per assembled repo root rather
    than once per row.

    WIRING POSITION — chosen over the chunk body's literal text, recorded
    here per the EM ruling requiring the choice named in the commit
    message: the chunk body says "call it from `run_pre_sync_gates`, in
    the same position as `assert_allowlist_applied`". That position is
    PRE-SYNC, on a SINGLE row's restricted source tree — the EM ruling
    (2026-08-28, this chunk's brief) already forecloses gating pre-
    transform bytes as reproducing the exact adjacent-question defect this
    plan exists to kill, and requires either (a) materializing the content-
    transform sweep over a copy of the restricted tree at that same
    pre-sync position, or (b) — if the sweep is not callable as a function
    over an arbitrary tree — falling back to wiring the gate at the
    destination after sync but before the row is finalized/pushed.

    (a) is not available: the content-transform sweep is `engine_claude_klabauter.
    run_percolate(..., phase="post_rsync", ...)`, a JSON-RPC dispatch
    against a resolved `percolate-store.yaml` section, `dest_prefix`, and
    `sync_changed_paths` — not a standalone function over an arbitrary
    directory. It is also inherently PER-ROW: each row's own restricted
    tree is a fragment of the assembled mirror (`staging_dir` is "NOT a
    repo root -- it is `target.dest_dir`'s own subtree in isolation", §
    `dispatch_preswap_function_gate`'s own docstring), so even a
    successfully materialized per-row copy could not answer the per-MIRROR
    question C2 exists to ask — the same structural gap the parent plan's
    Problem section names as the reason C1's per-row closure gate missed
    every orphan: "a per-row gate cannot answer a per-mirror question
    however much it is widened."

    (b) is what this function implements, using the SAME "destination
    after sync, before the row is finalized/pushed" seam this module
    already built for exactly this shape: `deduped_roots` / `rows_by_
    repo_root`, the destination working tree AFTER every row has synced,
    checked here as one of the "four/five legs [that] always run" before
    `main()` decides whether to report the round clean — publishing (git
    add/commit/push of the destination) is a LATER, separate step this
    driver does not itself perform, so a refusal here still costs
    finalization, never merely a log line after the fact.

    EXEMPTIONS — `dispatch_end_of_run_assembled_mirror_gate` itself never
    reads the exemption ledger; its caller resolves `{name: reason}` via
    `_load_assembled_mirror_gate_exemptions` and passes it in as `out`-
    directed context is not the shape needed here, so lookups happen right
    below: for a FAILING `repo_root`, this function checks whether ANY row
    named in `rows_by_repo_root[repo_root]` (§ same dict every sibling leg
    already receives) has a declared exemption entry. A repo root can be
    reached by more than one publish target row (docs/reference,
    coordinator_core, coordinator/bin, ... all sharing one destination
    checkout) — declaring the exemption against any ONE of them is
    sufficient, since the exemption is debt against the ASSEMBLED tree,
    not against a particular row's contribution to it. A match WARNS
    (prints the declared reason, does not fail this repo root); no match
    is the FATAL post-condition the chunk body specifies -- "like `assert_
    allowlist_applied`'s: no override flag" -- surfaced here as `ok=False`
    for that repo root, same reporting contract (never raises) as every
    other end-of-run leg in this module.

    Never called under `--dry-run`, same as `dispatch_end_of_run_argv_
    parity_gate`: a preview run mutates no destination for this gate to
    meaningfully collect against. `target_filtered` is accepted for call-
    site symmetry with the other end-of-run legs (same signature shape);
    this gate is FAIL-HARD unconditionally, same choice and same reasoning
    as `dispatch_end_of_run_argv_parity_gate`'s own docstring: a `--target`
    subset publish is exactly the invocation shape most likely to leave the
    assembled tree skewed, never an excuse to stop checking it.

    Returns True iff every repo root's collection either passes cleanly or
    is covered by a declared exemption; False iff any repo root's
    collection errors/times out/finds an unexpected shape with no matching
    exemption, or `repo_root` is not a directory. Never raises."""

# `__pycache__/` is a LOCALLY-GENERATED build artifact, not something any
# row's sync ever copies into the destination (verified:
# `coordinator/lib/percolate/publish_sync.py` contains zero `__pycache__`/
# `.pyc` references, same as the `.git` rationale above) — anything that
# subsequently RUNS Python inside the destination clone (a pytest run, a
# stray `python -m` invocation) recreates `__pycache__/*.pyc` there on its
# own, with no row ever having "published" it. First measured live: a real
# `claude-klabauter-publish-repo-toplevel` run reported 499 such entries,
# every one `coordinator_core/**/__pycache__/*.pyc` — pure noise that drowns
# a real finding, not a content decision, so (like `.git`) it is a
# STRUCTURAL exclusion at the mechanism level, never a per-file ratified
# exception (which would mean one entry per generated `.pyc` filename
# forever, on every Python version bump, the exact two-tables-rot shape this
# whole workstream exists to close). Detection itself lives in
# `percolate.publish_sync._is_structural_build_artifact` — shared with that
# module's own orphan-sweep guard, see `_is_structurally_never_published`
# below for how this function delegates to it.


def _is_structurally_never_published(path: Path, repo_root: Path) -> bool:
    """True iff `path` (a file under `repo_root`) is excluded from the
    `published` set at the mechanism level — `.git/*` plumbing, a dest-local
    `.fleet-env/*` virtualenv, `__pycache__/*` build-artifact directories, or a
    stray `*.pyc`/`*.pyo` outside one (the rare pre-`__pycache__`-layout shape,
    still bytecode a row never publishes). Kept as one predicate so both
    `published`-set comprehensions in
    `dispatch_end_of_run_unscanned_published_check` stay in lockstep rather
    than drifting via copy-paste.

    `__pycache__`/`.pyc`/`.pyo` detection delegates to `percolate.publish_sync
    ._is_structural_build_artifact` — the SAME predicate the orphan-sweep /
    top-level-presence guard in that module now uses, so the two guards
    cannot silently disagree about what counts as a locally-generated build
    artifact.

    `.git`/`.fleet-env` stay local to this function rather than folding into
    `_is_structural_build_artifact`: `_is_structurally_never_published` walks a
    WHOLE repo tree (including `.git/` and a dest-local `.fleet-env/`) that
    `publish_sync.py` has no equivalent for — that module's callers only ever
    see already-restricted rel_path strings with every dot-prefixed top-level
    directory (`.git`, `.fleet-env` alike) already filtered out upstream
    (`_sync_mirror_top_level_files`'s `not p.name.startswith(".")`, the
    orphan-sweep's own `non_dot_dst` filter — see that module's own comment on
    this split), so a `.fleet-env` name reaching `_is_structural_build_
    artifact` there would be dead code, never a live input. Sourced from
    `coordinator_core.percolate.surface.STRUCTURAL_NEVER_PUBLISHED_PREFIXES`
    (§ module comment above) rather than a local literal, so this leg cannot
    silently diverge from `guards._walk_for_guard`/`engine.run_parse_sweep`'s
    own copies of the same tuple.

    PUBLISH-STAGING LEFTOVERS ARE STRUCTURAL HERE TOO, via the same
    `surface.PUBLISH_STAGING_DIR_RE` SSOT the content-transform sweep prunes
    on. This was the FIFTH consumer of that predicate and the last to get it:
    while `iter_surface_files` still walked into staging directories, their
    files landed in BOTH the `published` set and the `visited` set and the
    subtraction came out empty, so the asymmetry was invisible. The moment the
    sweep began pruning them, `published` still listed them and `visited` no
    longer did -- and every file under a stray `.prior` staging directory
    reported as published-but-unscanned. The bytes never ship either way; a
    directory the sweep is not allowed to enter cannot be held against it for
    not having been entered.

    Matched against DIRECTORY segments only, never the basename: a *file*
    named `x-publish-staging-y.py` is real shipped payload, the same
    distinction `store.py` and `engine.run_parse_sweep` already draw."""

         the row's staged content has been verified and swapped into the
         real destination) — never the whole repo root. A file elsewhere
         under the repo root (shipped by a prior publish, excluded by
         `--target`, or belonging to a row this run skipped via a failed
         pre-sync gate) was not published BY THIS RUN and is therefore out of
         scope for its verdict; comparing it against `scanned` (which only
         ever records what THIS run's sweep visited, never a prior run's)
         produced exactly this false positive. When the caller omits
         `published_dest_dirs_by_repo_root` (`None`, e.g. every pre-existing
         test in `test_unscanned_published_gate.py`), `published` falls back
         to every file that actually exists under the repo root right now
         (the pre-fix ground truth) — the production call site (`main`)
         always supplies it; the fallback exists purely for back-compat with
         callers/tests that never run a real staged sync over their
         fixtures.
      2. `scanned` — § `visited_files_by_repo_root` below (unscanned-published-
         guard-hole fix, cross-repo/inbox "the store is ours and inject bypasses
         the sweep" follow-on): when the caller supplies it, `scanned` is
         `visited_files_by_repo_root.get(repo_root, set())` — the REAL set of
         files this run's `post_rsync` content-transform sweep and inject scrub
         actually read successfully (§ `engine.PhaseResult.visited_files`,
         `engine.run_inject_for_section`'s own `visited_sink`), unioned across
         every row sharing this repo root. This is a HARD requirement of the
         fix: re-deriving eligibility via `iter_surface_files(row.dest_dir,
         **row's file_surface)` AT CHECK TIME (the pre-fix behavior, still the
         fallback below) cannot distinguish a file the sweep actually visited
         from one that merely happens to satisfy the same eligibility params
         NOW — e.g. a file `inject` copied AFTER the sweep already finished
         walking the tree, which would re-derive as "eligible" and pass clean
         despite never having been scrubbed by anything. When the caller omits
         `visited_files_by_repo_root` (`None`, e.g. every pre-existing test in
         `test_unscanned_published_gate.py`, which asserts the ELIGIBILITY
         logic itself with no real sweep run over its fixtures), `scanned`
         falls back to the pre-fix UNION, across every row (`ResolvedTarget`,
         resolved `section`) whose destination resolves to this repo root, of
         `iter_surface_files(row.dest_dir, **row's file_surface)` — a row's
         dest_dir can be the repo root itself (a toplevel row) or a
         subdirectory of it (§ `_dest_repo_root`), and DIFFERENT rows can
         declare DIFFERENT `file_surface` params for overlapping trees;
         unioning is deliberate there too — a file is fine if AT LEAST ONE
         applicable row's sweep would visit it, matching "is this file ever
         transformed by anything," not "does every row's own narrower config
         individually cover it." The production call site (`main`) always
         supplies `visited_files_by_repo_root`; the fallback exists purely for
         back-compat with callers/tests exercising eligibility in isolation.
      3. `unscanned = published - scanned`. Each entry is a HARD failure
         UNLESS its repo-root-relative path is a key in
         `_load_unscanned_exceptions()` — in which case it is still
         PRINTED (never silently absorbed into a clean pass — a deliberate
         exclusion is a visible decision, not a silence) but does not fail
         the run.

    Unlike `dispatch_end_of_run_identity_check`/
    `..._install_doc_payload_check`, this check does NOT degrade to
    advisory under `--target`: each finding is evaluated against a single
    row's own dest tree and that row's own (unioned) scanned set — there is
    no cross-row "the sibling row hasn't published yet" dependency for this
    property to legitimately be incomplete about, so `target_filtered` is
    accepted for signature symmetry with the other two legs but does not
    change severity here (documented explicitly rather than silently
    ignored).

    Returns True iff every repo root's unscanned set is either empty or
    fully covered by ratified exceptions; False otherwise. Never raises for
    a missing/malformed exceptions file at the "no entries" case — only a
    malformed ENTRY (present but missing `path`/`reason`) raises, via
    `_load_unscanned_exceptions`, and that propagates here as an
    unavailable-check failure (fail-closed, matching the other two legs'
    unimportable-checker handling) rather than being swallowed.

    `_is_structurally_never_published` (`.git/*`, `__pycache__/*`,
    stray `*.pyc`/`*.pyo`) is excluded from the
    `published` set at the mechanism level, not via the ratified-exceptions
    list: `.git/` is the destination repo's own pre-existing git plumbing —
    no row's sync ever copies INTO or deletes FROM it (verified:
    `coordinator/lib/percolate/publish_sync.py` contains zero `.git`
    references; its `sync_mirror`/`sync_flat_mirror` walks are scoped to
    named source-derived subtrees that never include it) — yet a toplevel
    row's `dest_dir` being the repo root means `iter_surface_files`'s raw
    `os.walk` DOES descend into it, and every `.git/*` entry (`HEAD`,
    `config`, `hooks/*.sample`, ...) correctly never matches any
    `include_extensions`/`shebang_prefixes`, so it is real, reproducible
    "unscanned." First confirmed live: this leg's first run against the
    real payload (via `percolate-full-payload-proof.py`) reported ~20 such
    entries before this exclusion was added. Treating `.git/*` as a
    "deliberate exclusion" via the ratified-exceptions file would require
    one entry per git-internal filename forever (and more on every git
    version bump) — the two-tables-rot shape this whole workstream is
    closing, not an instance of it to add to. `.git` is structural, not a
    content decision, so it is excluded here, not ratified there.

    self-location walk-up rung (from this file's own location) ahead of the

    longer depends on the registry having been populated on this machine.

    Fallback order on ANY native-resolver failure (missing cc_invoke.py,
    an unresolvable engine root, missing coordinator_core.percolate.runtime_root
    module, or an exception raised by it):
      1. Native resolver (above) — preferred, resolves the true percolation
         source root. Post-C1/C4, this is the ONLY correctness mechanism in
         the ordinary case: `coordinator_percolate_runtime_root()` itself now
         consults the registry-first `.doe-root` pointer rung ahead of the
         shared-install rung, so a correct DoE-clone answer is already

         validated by the presence of `setup/publish-targets.portable` at the
         pointed-to root. This is a cold-start backstop for genuine
         native-resolver failure (missing cc_invoke, an unresolvable
         engine root) — a case rung 1's in-process pointer rung structurally
         cannot cover, because this local read runs while LOCATING the engine
         root and so cannot depend on having already located it. It is not, and
         post-C1/C4 no longer reads as, the primary correctness mechanism —
         it only fires when rung 1 has already failed outright.
      3. This repo's own root (`_REPO_ROOT`), with a non-fatal degrade
         warning — `_REPO_ROOT` is this repo's own root and is KNOWN-WRONG for
         locating `setup/` post-b644d5a9 (publish.py relocated into this repo's
         tree, out of the percolation source tree); rung 2 exists precisely
         to give a correct answer before falling back to this known-wrong
         last resort.

    Open question (not this chunk): whether rung 2's local
    `_read_doe_root_pointer()` read should later converge onto the shared

    forbids asserting a sha for THIS round's outcome; it does not require
    forgetting that the row ever published, and forgetting is what made the

    to carry THIS OPERATOR'S machine-local patterns — a real name, a private
    hostname fragment, a local path segment — and on a managed-remote container
    there is no such identity on disk to leak. The tree is a fresh clone and the
    settings home is seeded by the session, so demanding the operator populate
    a file about a machine that will be reclaimed blocks the publish on data
    that cannot exist.

    WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE, because the file is not the audit. Phase 4's built-in
    net — persona-name patterns, the cross-platform home-path patterns, the
    fail-closed `check_scrub_canary` — runs over the full payload either way.
    `.percolate-identity` only ADDS operator-specific patterns on top. Degrading
    narrows the audit; it does not switch it off, and the WARNING says which half
    is missing rather than implying a clean bill.

    THE GUARD STAYS IN THE CHAIN. `identity_file_exists` still reports the truth
    downstream, so `warn_machine_slug_net` still fires its own per-target warning
    — the stand-down is a downgrade in severity, never a removal
    (`coordinator/docs/wiki/coordinator-tripwires/tripwire-registry/
    a-guard-that-stands-down-must-still-be-in-the-chain.md`).

    defaults PERMISSIVE — for them permissive means "stand down", which is the
    safe direction. Here permissive would mean "skip a personal-data gate before
    a PUBLIC publish", which is the unsafe direction. So this asks TWO things of
    the same ratified module and requires both: the `ephemeral_host` capability
    AND `detect_venue() == "remote"`. They read the same evidence, so requiring
    both costs nothing on a real container — but `detect_venue` does not fail
    open, so a probe that raised and defaulted permissive cannot on its own
    unlock the degrade. An unimportable module keeps the FATAL.

    A DURABLE SELF-HOSTED RUNNER sets the same markers, and the probe's own
    evidence string says so. That box DOES carry operator identity, and its
    operator overrides with `COORDINATOR_CAP_EPHEMERAL_HOST=0` — the module's

    WHY THIS EXISTS. `publish-allowlist-generate.py` derives field 7 of the two
    `claude-klabauter*` rows from `setup/publish-allowlist-declarations.yaml`.
    When it refuses — a stale (no-longer-tracked) `deny` entry, a missing AC9
    contract root, a directory-granular name denied or untracked — it writes
    nothing and field 7 keeps its last good value. Every gate downstream then reads a
    CSV that is internally consistent, importable, and no longer what the
    declarations imply, and the round publishes green. That happened three
    times on 2026-09-01, and `--check` had been red at HEAD since 2026-08-28
    with an open backlog row naming it, because nothing between a red `--check`
    and a published mirror stopped the mirror
    (`state/bug-backlog/2026-08-28-the-publish-path-never-runs-the-validator-
    that-declares-its-allowlist-valid.yaml`, whose negative spec forbids
    closing this by adding `--check` to yet another test — three already
    existed and all three were red).

    This is the production caller that validator never had, and it is the same
    promotion `find_import_closure_violations` got on 2026-08-13 after two
    broken mirror rounds shipped past a detector that lived only inside a test
    file. See `run_pre_sync_gates` for the wiring.

    WHY RE-DERIVATION RATHER THAN A STAMP. Field 7 could have carried the tree
    state it was generated from, so a stale one reads as stale. That is a
    second artifact needing its own freshness guarantee — the defect wearing a
    hat. Re-deriving at publish time has no cached half that can itself go
    stale, and it compares CONTENT rather than asking which file is older: a
    field 7 can be NEWER than its sources and still wrong, because the
    generator that would have changed it never ran to completion. The stamp
    axis cannot close that, and for this artifact it cannot even be declared —
    `setup/publish-targets.portable` is `#`-commented pipe-delimited text with
    no `.json` key and no `---` frontmatter, so `compute_pair_staleness`
    short-circuits UNSTAMPED before it reaches `sources`
    (measured by claude-klabauter-a8, 2026-09-01).

    Fail-closed on its own failure to run: if the validator cannot be loaded or
    raises, the third element is None, meaning "row scope unknown — refuse
    every allowlisted row". A gate that cannot say which rows it governs must
    not silently govern none, and this driver aborts rather than degrades
    everywhere else it cannot complete a check (see the module docstring's
    AC15 fail-closed paragraph). This is NOT the DR-402 case: that decision
    governs a session-hot-path guard whose engine is unreachable, and its
    § "What this does NOT license" is explicit that its allow rung is for a
    guard that could not run, never a publish path granting itself a bypass."""

    """Return shape for `run_pre_sync_gates`. `proceed=False` means the
    caller must skip this target (mirrors a bash `continue` in the main
    loop). `source_dir` is the EFFECTIVE source dir sync should read from —
    when the target declares an allowlist, this is the restricted temp tree
    `build_allowlisted_source` produced. Otherwise (docs/plans/2026-08-04-
    publish-from-a-committed-ref.md C1b) it is the materialized committed-ref
    SHADOW of the target's resolved `source_dir` — NEVER the target's raw
    resolved `source_dir` itself; even the un-allowlisted row, which never
    enters the allowlist branch, is repointed at its shadow before this
    function returns. `restricted_tmp_src` is the allowlist-narrowed temp
    tree (or None when no allowlist was declared) — threaded through so the
    caller (`process_target`) can remove it after sync completes, on both
    the success and failure paths.

    `shadow_roots` (C6) are the materialized committed-ref shadow trees
    created for this target's contributing roots, deduplicated by (git
    toplevel, sha) — see `_git_materialize_ref`. They must OUTLIVE this
    function's return on the success path: `process_target` reads through
    them across `dispatch_standalone_guards`, the mirror/manifest sync,
    `dispatch_percolate_post_rsync`, and `dispatch_percolate_pre_ci`, so this
    function cannot remove them locally the way it does `restricted_tmp_src`
    on the allowlist-branch failures. The caller removes every path in
    `shadow_roots` — via `_cleanup_shadow_roots`, which also evicts the
    process-lifetime materialization cache so a later target sharing the
    same (toplevel, sha) re-extracts rather than reading a deleted
    directory — both on its early `not proceed` return and in its `finally`
    block, since a gate failure that occurs AFTER materialization (e.g. a
    version-regression or version-consistency failure) still owns shadow
    trees that were already created and must not leak."""

    `identity_file_exists`/`identity` are its already-computed results,
    threaded through for the machine-slug warn.)

    Before any gate reads source bytes, every contributing root
    (docs/plans/2026-08-04-publish-from-a-committed-ref.md C1b) is
    materialized from its committed ref via `_git_materialize_ref` — pinned to
    the round-wide sha in `round_pinned_shas` (§ `_round_pin_source_sha`) rather
    than a fresh per-call `HEAD` resolution, so every row in this round
    reads the same commit for a shared toplevel even if HEAD moves mid-round. `GateResult.source_dir`
    is UNCONDITIONALLY the shadow of `target.source_dir` from that point on —
    never the target's raw resolved `source_dir` — so even a row with no
    declared allowlist (which never enters the branch below) publishes from a
    committed ref, not the live tree. `check_marketplace_version_regression`
    and `check_version_consistency` run AFTER materialization for the same
    reason: they read raw source directly, so reading the live tree there
    could ship a version regression past the gate that exists to stop it.
    A dirty source tree is NOT a gate of any kind here and never slows a
    publish down: the bytes always come from the committed ref, so
    uncommitted peer edits can neither leak into the published output nor
    refuse the row. When an allowlist IS declared, `build_allowlisted_source` narrows the
    already-materialized shadow tree — it receives shadow roots via
    `real_src` + `source_map`, unchanged in shape, with no `git archive`
    knowledge of its own.

    Allowlist enforcement (`coordinator/lib/percolate/allowlist.py`) runs
    LAST, in the same position `setup/publish.sh` runs it — after
    the machine-slug warn, before the pre-rsync hooks / `case "$mode"`
    dispatch, and it never tests `target.mode`: a flat-mirror row
    can carry an allowlist exactly as a mirror row can (AC18(b)). On success
    `GateResult.source_dir` is repointed to the restricted temp tree
    `build_allowlisted_source` produced; on any allowlist-gate failure this
    returns `proceed=False` (mirrors the bash `continue`) having already
    cleaned up its own temp tree.

        # carrying this stamp rotates its generation when a publish ships new
        # engine code and at no other time — see
        # `coordinator_core.warm.skew.compute_client_token`.
        #
        # THAT LAST SENTENCE WAS ASPIRATIONAL UNTIL 2026-08-21, and the writer
        # here, not the reader in skew.py, was the half breaking it: this row's
        # `root_shas[target.source_dir]` is round-pinned raw toplevel HEAD

        # branch, not only an engine-touching one — so every round rewrote the
        # stamp regardless of content and the token rotated every ~9min publish
        # cycle right back to the coarseness this stamp exists to remove.
        # Measured: 55%/33% of warm generations exited skew/superseded at
        # medians of ~7min/~2.5min against a 15min idle deadline. Fixed by

        # stamp there would name a generation nothing reads.

        # Written here rather than committed into the source tree because a

    this). A leg that mostly SPAWNS therefore reports a small `cpu` and a

) -> "frozenset[str]":
    """Which destination top-level directory names under `target`'s own
    `dest_dir` D belong to some OTHER row in the resolved row set, not to
    `target` itself — the claim index `dispatch_mirror_like`'s orphan sweep
    must exempt (§ docs/plans/2026-09-06-the-orphan-sweep-learns-what-a-sibling-r.md).
    A disabled row is commented out of `setup/publish-targets.portable`, so
    `load_targets` never emits it in the first place — there is no
    enabled/disabled field on `ResolvedTarget` to filter on, and none is
    needed: `all_rows` already contains only rows that exist.

    Both sides of the containment check below are `.resolve()`d before
    comparison. `dest_dir` is a bare `Path(dest)` (`parse_target_row`), never
    pre-resolved, so an unresolved lexical comparison would miss two rows
    whose `dest_dir`s denote the same on-disk location but are spelled
    differently — a surviving `.`/`..` segment, a symlinked component, or a
    Windows short-name vs long-name spelling — and raise `ValueError` for that
    pair instead of finding the containment. That failure is fail-CLOSED (the
    sibling's directory is treated as a stray orphan, which either gets
    deleted or FATAL-aborts the publish), which is exactly the hazard this
    whole change exists to close — "fails safe" is therefore not a reason to
    skip resolving. `Path.resolve()` is non-strict on 3.11+: it does not
    require the path to exist, so a destination not yet created on disk still
    resolves to a normalized absolute path and this check works before the
    first publish ever creates it.

    For every row in `all_rows` other than `target`, if that row's
    `dest_dir` is STRICTLY under D, the first path segment of its relative
    path is a name D's own orphan sweep must not touch. Path-SEGMENT
    arithmetic (`Path.relative_to`), never a string prefix test — `/a/bc`
    must never read as under `/a/b`.

    A row whose `dest_dir` EQUALS D contributes nothing: it shares D's root
    rather than claiming a subdirectory of it, so there is no top-level name
    to exempt on its behalf. A row outside D (an unrelated dest root, or a
    parent of D) contributes nothing either.

    The `is` check above is a cheap guard for callers that pass `target` as
    a member of `all_rows` by the same object (as the tests do) — but it is
    NOT what excludes `target`'s own entry in production. `main()` builds
    `all_rows` from its own unfiltered `parse_target_row` pass, separate
    from the `parsed_rows` dict `target` comes from, so `other is target` is
    never True there for `target`'s own row. What actually excludes it in
    production is the `rel == Path(".")` branch below: `target`'s own entry
    has `dest_dir == dest`, so `rel` resolves to `Path(".")` and is skipped.
    That branch is therefore LOAD-BEARING and must not be deleted as
    apparently-redundant with the `is` check.

    Keep both mechanisms. Excluding `target` by path equality ALONE (instead
    of also keeping the `is` check) would risk conflating `target` with a
    real sibling that happens to share the same `dest_dir`: two distinct
    rows can legitimately land at one `dest_dir`, and such a sibling must
    still be considered on its own terms (it contributes nothing here only
    because its own `dest_dir` is not STRICTLY under D, not because it was
    discarded via a path match against `target`).

    `all_rows` must be the UNFILTERED row set (`load_targets(setup_dir,
    target_filter="", err=io.StringIO())`, parsed) — a `--target`-narrowed
    set would make a sibling's claim invisible and turn this into an
    orphan-deleting false negative (see this function's own caller in
    `main()`, resolved once per run, never per row)."""

    a per-root override such as DoE's `setup/publish_sync.py`) and the two
    cannot land the parameter atomically — a copy that lags would raise
    `TypeError` mid-publish if the kwarg were passed unconditionally.

    Review: coordinator:code-reviewer — this is a by-name check
    (`"foreign_dir_names" in sig.parameters`), not "would the call succeed."
    A `sync_mirror(..., **kwargs)` signature would happily swallow the kwarg
    without raising, but this probe reports `False` for it and the call site
    omits the kwarg entirely. That is deliberate and safe (no crash, no
    behavior claimed that isn't backed by a parameter the target module
    actually reads), but it does mean a hypothetical override that forwards
    `**kwargs` internally would never receive the value from this path.

    Checked ONCE per run, beside the AC15 `check_publish_sync_contract`
    call in `main()` — never per row. When the resolved copy lacks the
    parameter, callers must omit the kwarg entirely rather than pass
    `foreign_dir_names=None`: today's behaviour (empty exemption set) is
    exactly what omitting it preserves.

    Deliberately NOT folded into `_mirror_dispatch_kwargs`/AC15's bind

    dispatch. Called ONCE in `main()`, pre-loop — never per-target (a
    per-target check only fails loud "before any dispatch" accidentally,

    the engine-side `coordinator/lib/percolate/publish_sync.py` fallback (§
    `_resolve_publish_sync_module_path`, AMENDED 2026-08-03) — it validates
    the interface, never provenance, so both paths stay fail-closed alike.

    For each of `sync_mirror`/`sync_flat_mirror`:
      1. the symbol must be present on the module;
      2. `inspect.signature` must be computable on it;
      3. its signature must not be a bare `*args`/`**kwargs` wrapper (that
         would satisfy a superficial signature check while still failing at
         runtime for arguments python's binder cannot actually place);
      4. `inspect.signature(fn).bind_partial(**mirror_kwargs)` must succeed
         against the SAME dict `_mirror_dispatch_kwargs` builds for the real
         call site — never a separately hand-maintained name list.

    `load_ignore` gets the same four-part treatment (presence, inspectable
    signature, not a bare var-wrapper, binds a single path-or-None argument)
    — closing the gap `_MIRROR_ENTRY_POINTS` alone left open:
    `dispatch_mirror_like` also calls `publish_sync_module.load_ignore(...)`
    at dispatch time, so a module that cleared the pre-loop gate on
    `sync_mirror`/`sync_flat_mirror` alone could still `AttributeError` (or
    raise a `TypeError` from an incompatible signature) mid-publish — the
    exact fail-open this gate exists to prevent, and it matters more now
    that a second module can win the seam (§ AMENDED 2026-08-03).

    `modes_in_run` (AMENDED 2026-08-10) narrows WHICH descriptors are
    checked to the wire names this run's rows actually dispatch — see the
    loop's own comment for why the table-wide form was an over-reach that
    took a peer repo's publish down over a mode it never uses. `None` (the
    default) preserves the original check-every-mode behaviour for callers
    that have no row set to hand in. It never weakens a check that DOES
    run: a mode present in the run is validated exactly as before, all four
    parts.

    Raises `PublishSyncContractError` naming: (1) `module_path`, (2) the
    missing symbol/parameter, (3) `rung_label` (from C1's
    `coordinator_percolate_runtime_root_explained()`, threaded through by the

    (§ that function's own docstring; `sync_flat_mirror` has no equivalent
    parameter — flat-mirror rows have no per-plugin top-level orphan sweep
    for a directory rename to collide against). `process_target` resolves
    this from the row's own rename-generation ledger BEFORE this call, so
    a directory the upcoming content-transform sweep is about to reproduce
    is exempted from this sync pass's own orphan-deletion (state/audits/
    2026-08-05-first-full-payload-identity-findings.md Group E).

    `changed_sink` (optional, § docs/plans/2026-08-16-percolate-round-
    timing-and-changed-only.md chunk C4): when supplied, it is passed to
    `sync_fn` as its `changed_paths` param and the sync engine populates it
    directly from each real `_needs_copy` copy decision, in the same
    `dst_dir`-relative posix id shape `dispatch_percolate_post_rsync`'s
    `visited_files`/`changed_files` already use. `REMOVE:` deletions are
    excluded there — a deletion is not new content for the entrypoint gate's
    closure walk to re-scan.

    This signal is NOT derived from `sync_fn`'s printed output. It was, and a
    scrape cannot express "I do not know": a format change silently yields an
    empty set, and empty means "skip the sweep" to the consumer, so the failure
    landed on the narrow side and shipped an unswept entrypoint. The
    undeterminable case belongs to the caller, which passes `None` and gets a
    full sweep. `None` here (the default, every pre-existing call site) is a
    no-op. `sync_fn`'s stdout is untouched either way.

    `foreign_dir_names` (default `None`, forwarded to `sync_mirror` ONLY,
    gated on `mode_descriptor.accepts_foreign_dir_names` in the same `if`
    ladder as `renamed_dir_names` — § docs/plans/2026-09-06-the-orphan-
    sweep-learns-what-a-sibling-r.md): the destination top-level directory
    names another row in the resolved row set claims under `target`'s own
    `dest_dir`, so this row's own orphan sweep does not delete a sibling
    row's published output. `process_target` resolves this from the row's REAL `dest_dir`
    (`foreign_dir_names_for_row`), never from `sync_target` — same reasoning
    as `sweep_top_level_orphans` above, verbatim: `sync_target.dest_dir` is
    the staging tree, and a staging path says nothing about which top-level
    names a sibling row owns at the real destination. Only forwarded when
    `module_accepts_foreign_dir_names` is also true (default False) — the
    resolved `publish_sync` copy may lag behind this parameter (§
    `_module_accepts_foreign_dir_names`), and passing an unsupported kwarg
    would raise `TypeError` mid-publish; the caller probes this ONCE per
    run, never per row.

    `sweep_top_level_orphans` (default False, forwarded to `sync_mirror` ONLY --
    § `PublishModeDescriptor.accepts_sweep_top_level_orphans`; `sync_flat_mirror`
    has always swept its top-level files and takes no flag) authorizes deleting
    destination top-level FILES the source no longer has. The caller decides,
    and must decide from the row's REAL `dest_dir`, never from the `sync_target`
    this function receives: `process_target` rewrites that to the staging tree
    (`sync_target = replace(target, dest_dir=staging_dir)`), and a staging tree's
    path shape says nothing about whether the row lands at a mirror repo's root
    or in a subdirectory the row owns outright. Deriving it here would read the
    staging path and get the answer wrong in the direction that deletes."""

    WHY THIS EXISTS. A percolate commit subject named the paths it carried
    and the rows that produced them, but never the SOURCE commit those bytes
    were cut from — so neither party to the publish seam could tell whether a
    given mirror was current. A consumer executing the mirror could only
    answer "does my fix live here?" by grepping engine source for the fix's
    own text (project-rag-ue-addon-em, 2026-08-31: a fix committed here at
    `40abe011d` stayed live as a crash for a mirror consumer, and the only
    available currency check was a hand-rolled grep for `if parsed.tzinfo is
    None`). With the source-head sha in the subject, `git -C <mirror> log -1`
    names the source commit the round ran from.

    IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT A GIVEN FIX IS IN THE PUBLISHED BYTES. This
    paragraph used to end "`git -C <source> merge-base --is-ancestor <fix>
    <stamp>` answers it exactly", and that sentence is why this defect cost
    what it did: a consumer ran exactly that query, got `yes`, and the fix
    was not in the mirror (2026-09-04, example-cockpit-repo-30). The query answers
    only whether the fix was in the SOURCE's history at publish time, which
    is a different question from whether the published bytes contain it --
    see the block above. Do not restore an "exactly" here.

    Two modes, one function (review-integrator, 2026-09-01 — collapsed from
    a second `_pinned_source_sha_suffix` copy per overengineering-reviewer
    finding 1, once the peer claim on this file released): with
    `round_pinned_shas` absent, reads `HEAD` fresh — the CLI-standalone path
    with no pin in hand. With `round_pinned_shas` given, uses
    `_round_pin_source_sha`'s cached value instead, closing the race a fresh
    `HEAD` read would reopen — `_commit_published_dests` runs at the very

    from round-start and most exposed to a peer commit landing mid-run
    (docs/plans/2026-08-04-publish-from-a-committed-ref.md: four distinct
    SHAs observed across one round).

    Degrades to `""` rather than raising or blocking a publish in either
    mode: `head_sha` returns `None` on an unborn/detached-nothing HEAD, and
    `_round_pin_source_sha` raises `GitMaterializeError` on the same class of
    failure — a commit subject without the stamp is strictly what this
    function's absence produced. Zero-spawn by construction (`head_sha`

    (`docs/plans/2026-08-19-burn-down-the-amplification-hitlist.md` C5).
    Unlike `_argv_parity_pairing_origin`/`_git_ls_tree_entries_files` (which
    batch several entries into ONE spawn against a SHARED `-C <root>`), this
    function's callers each pass a DIFFERENT repo root per call (one row's
    `target.dest_dir` per invocation), so there is no shared `git` argv to
    fold multiple calls into — the only way to collapse the per-item spawn
    is to stop spawning at all. `coordinator_core.git.git_dir` exists for
    exactly this shape (its own docstring: "must stay cheap and
    Windows-safe... a cold subprocess per call is exactly the shape
    CLAUDE.md's Runtime conventions calls break-class") and already handles
    the worktree/submodule `.git`-is-a-file indirection this function must
    not silently mishandle.

    Resolves HEAD by reading `<gitdir>/HEAD` directly:
      - A detached HEAD (`<sha>`, no `ref: ` prefix) is returned as-is.
      - A symbolic HEAD (`ref: refs/heads/<branch>`) is resolved against
        the repo's COMMON dir (never the private per-worktree gitdir —
        refs live in the common dir) as a loose ref file first, falling
        back to a `packed-refs` scan if no loose ref file exists (an
        unpacked-but-referenced branch is the exceptional case, not the
        rule, so the loose-file read is tried first).

    Returns `""` on ANY resolution failure — missing `.git`, empty/
    unparseable `HEAD`, a detached-HEAD line that isn't a validly-shaped
    sha (review finding amp-s1 #6: a corrupt `HEAD` file is neither a
    `ref:` pointer nor a real object id, and `git rev-parse HEAD` fails
    closed on it -- returning the garbage text verbatim would be a
    fail-open divergence from that replaced path even though no CURRENT
    caller depends on the value being sha-shaped), a `ref:` pointer with no
    loose file and no matching `packed-refs` entry, or any `OSError`
    reading these files — the exact same fail-closed shape the replaced

    run's `--target` filter (the shared `_MATERIALIZED_REF_CACHE` shadow
    this toplevel+sha extracts to may still be read by a LATER row
    processed in the same run whose own root this pathspec must already
    cover — there is no second extraction to add it late), (b) every
    resolved store-declared inject `src` (§ `_all_inject_srcs_resolved`)
    that resolves under this toplevel — the shared-shadow hazard C5's
    dispatch brief names explicitly: a naive contributing-roots-only
    pathspec would silently drop inject's files from the shadow the SAME
    cache entry serves — and (c) `.percolate-ignore`, named EXPLICITLY per
    contributing root that actually carries one (never a blanket toplevel
    entry: `git archive` raises `fatal: pathspec ... did not match any
    files` for ANY single unmatched pathspec entry, even mixed with
    entries that do match, measured directly against this repo's own
    HEAD — so an ignore-file entry is only added when
    `(root / ".percolate-ignore").is_file()` is true, mirroring the
    `effective_source_dir / ".percolate-ignore"` existence check
    `dispatch_mirror_like` already applies).

    Cached per toplevel for the process lifetime — the same lifetime
    `_MATERIALIZED_REF_CACHE` itself uses — computed once, on the first
    (cache-MISS) extraction for that toplevel.

    A `toplevel` other than THIS repo's own (`_REPO_ROOT`) is not scoped at
    all — an empty tuple, meaning `_extract_git_archive` falls through to
    its pre-C5 full-tree behavior unchanged. Every contributing root and
    every store-declared inject `src` this repo's own configuration names
    resolves under `_REPO_ROOT` (§ `_git_materialize_ref`'s own docstring:
    "every contributing root... is a subdirectory of this repo's own
    single git toplevel"), so a DIFFERENT toplevel — a sibling checkout, or
    a throwaway repo a lower-level test builds directly to exercise
    `_extract_git_archive` in isolation (e.g.
    `test_publish_git_archive_eol_regimes.py`) — has no declared coverage
    to compute here in the first place; scoping it is "not this pathspec's
    business" (dispatch brief).

    Raises `GitMaterializeError` (fail-loud, never a silent full-tree
    fallback) when `toplevel` IS `_REPO_ROOT` and the computed pathspec is
    still empty: that is a real coverage bug, not an out-of-scope
    toplevel — nothing this run's declared configuration contributes
    resolves under this repo's own toplevel at all, which means archiving
    it here would either produce a useless empty shadow or (per the
    measured `git archive` behavior above) hard-fail inside
    `_extract_git_archive` anyway with a less legible error.

    `sha` (Review: code-reviewer — coverage must gate on the tree actually
    being archived, not the live working tree at compute time; a root or
    inject src tracked at `sha` but deleted/not-yet-materialized on disk
    was previously dropped from the pathspec with no error) defaults to
    this toplevel's current `HEAD` when omitted, so a root/src absent from
    the working tree but still tracked at `sha` is included regardless.
    Coverage against `sha` costs exactly ONE extra `git ls-tree` spawn per

    `_required_pathspec_for_toplevel` computes — the union of every
    contributing root `setup/publish-targets.portable` names, every
    resolved inject `src` under this toplevel, and each covered root's own
    `.percolate-ignore` (named explicitly; § `_required_pathspec_for_toplevel`
    docstring) — to a temp file, unpacked with `tarfile.extractall(filter=...)`.

    Pathspec-scoped is now the whole point (docs/plans/2026-08-21-the-
    payload-proves-itself-before-it-overwrites-the-engine.md C5): full-tree
    extraction pulled 31,213 files / 413MB to publish 5,055 files / 86.6MB,
    ~17,667 of the difference from `state/` alone, never published by any
    row. `.percolate-ignore` dropping out of a single-source shadow root and
    silently widening the publish set — the failure class the OLD
    (unconditionally-full-tree) version of this docstring refused scoping
    over — is answered by naming every covered root's ignore file
    explicitly in the pathspec rather than by refusing to scope at all;
    narrowing WHICH of the archived files a given row actually publishes
    remains `build_allowlisted_source`'s job, unchanged.

    `filter='tar'`, not `'data'`: `'data'` normalizes group/other
    permission bits, and this repo tracks 561 files at mode `100755`
    (all of `coordinator/bin/` and `bin/` — the payload of the
    `claude-klabauter-bin` publish row), whose executable bit must survive
    extraction byte-for-byte. `'tar'` still refuses absolute paths and `..`
    traversal — the safety property that matters for an archive this
    process produced itself. An explicit `filter=` is required regardless
    of choice: `DeprecationWarning` on 3.12/3.13, default flips on 3.14.

    Never a `tar` subprocess — that shell-out site is not a member of the
    closed list in `docs/reference/shell-out-carve-outs.md`.

    `-c core.autocrlf=false -c core.eol=lf`: on a Windows host with the
    invoking repo's eol config in play, a bare `git archive` applies the
    `text=auto` smudge and materializes CRLF for a file whose blob is LF. The
    mirror's `core.autocrlf` is `false`, so nothing normalizes it back at the
    destination, and a round would write whole-file line-ending flips across
    every published text file. Invisible on macOS/Linux, silent on Windows.

    Both flags are load-bearing, each in a DIFFERENT `.gitattributes` regime —
    do not strip either as redundant:

    - Path with **no `text` attribute** (e.g. this repo's vendored
      `cockpit-contract/LICENSE`): conversion is driven by `core.autocrlf`
      alone, so `autocrlf=false` disables it and `eol=lf` is the no-op.
      Measured, 3021-byte LF blob: bare 3082/61 CRLF; `eol=lf` alone 3082/61;
      `autocrlf=false` alone 3021/0; both 3021/0.
    - Path with explicit **`text=auto`** (DoE-claude sets `* text=auto`
      repo-wide, covering `coordinator/dist/publish-repo-toplevel/`): the
      ATTRIBUTE drives conversion and the target ending comes from `core.eol`,
      which defaults to `native` = CRLF on Windows. There `autocrlf=false`
      changes nothing and `eol=lf` is the load-bearing flag. Measured by
      doe-claude-em, 12290-byte LF blob: bare 12514/224 CRLF; both 12290/0.

    Only the pair is correct across both regimes. A regression pin must cover
    one path of each kind — a pin over attribute-free paths alone stays green
    if `eol=lf` is later dropped.

    recent commit AT OR BEFORE `pinned_sha` (the round's pinned content sha,
    `_round_pin_source_sha`'s return) that touches `_ENGINE_TOUCHING_PATHS`
    -- never `pinned_sha` itself.

    WHY: `pinned_sha` is round-pinned raw toplevel HEAD (docs/plans/
    2026-08-04-publish-from-a-committed-ref.md C1b) and moves on EVERY
    commit to the shared branch -- a doc, a `state/` artifact, any of
    50-70 concurrent sessions' unrelated work -- not only an engine-code
    commit. Writing it into the stamp verbatim (this function's predecessor)
    made `coordinator_core.warm.skew.compute_client_token` rotate on every
    publish round regardless of content, exactly the coarseness that
    function's own docstring claims is fixed ("changes when a publish ships
    new engine code, and at no other time") -- a promise the WRITER, not
    the reader, was breaking. Measured 2026-08-21: 55%/33% of warm
    generations exited `skew`/`superseded` at medians of ~7min/~2.5min
    against a 15min idle deadline, tracking the ~9min publish cadence
    (`docs/decisions/DR-335-publish-lag-is-surfaced-not-shortened.md`)
    almost exactly. Scoping to the last engine-touching ancestor makes the
    promise true: two rounds whose pins differ but share the same last
    engine-touching ancestor now write the IDENTICAL stamp, so the token
    does not rotate and a healthy warm server survives a round that ships
    it nothing new.

    SOUNDNESS -- never a false negative, i.e. never fails to rotate on a
    round that DID ship an engine change. `git log -1 <pinned_sha> --
    <paths>` walks `pinned_sha`'s own ancestry (never anything outside it)
    and returns the newest commit in that ancestry touching `paths` -- if
    engine code changed in any commit reachable from `pinned_sha`
    (`pinned_sha` itself included), that commit or a later one in the same
    ancestry is what this returns; it can therefore never return a sha
    OLDER than the true last engine change reachable from this round's
    pin. Same reasoning `publish_lag`'s own pathspec-scoped `git log`/
    `git rev-list` calls (`coordinator_core/warm/skew.py`) already rely on
    for merges -- git's ordinary history simplification finds the commit
    that actually introduced the difference. A revert is treated as an
    ordinary content-changing commit (it touches the paths), which is
    correct: the running server's source differs from a reverted state
    exactly as much as from any other edit, so eviction is still warranted.
    A first-ever publish has at least one commit touching `coordinator_core/`
    reachable from any HEAD -- this row IS that directory -- so the "no
    ancestor ever touched the paths" branch below should be unreachable in
    practice; it is handled defensively regardless, never asserted away.

    FALLBACK, never a silent no-stamp: any git failure (non-zero exit,
    `OSError`, or empty output because no ancestor touched the paths)
    returns `pinned_sha` UNSCOPED -- today's prior behaviour. That is
    always SAFE, never a false negative: it can only make the stamp rotate
    on a round that shipped no engine change (the defect this function
    exists to remove), never fail to rotate on one that did.

    LOGGING IS UNCONDITIONAL, deliberately, not gated on `scoped !=
    pinned_sha` (an earlier version of this function was gated that way).
    A gated print is silent in exactly the two cases that most need
    telling apart: `pinned_sha` itself is the last engine-touching commit

         prior output, never a human's, so the guard protects nothing
         there while permanently disabling the optimization. Conditions
         3-5 (store+transform signature, source HEAD, destination HEAD)
         still do the real correctness work for mirror rows: the
         destination HEAD leg still catches a mirror repo that advanced
         out from under this run (e.g. a human/other-automation commit),
         and the signature/source legs still catch any store, transform-
         code, or source change. This does NOT relax anything for

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Both this repo and the mirror run `core.fileMode=false`
    (Windows), so git never reads an exec bit off disk: a dest entry's mode is
    whatever `git add` first recorded, which is `100644` for anything newly
    added. `_extract_git_archive` deliberately preserves source modes through
    `filter='tar'`, but that work is discarded at the dest `git add`, so a
    shebanged entrypoint reaches a POSIX clone non-executable. The failure is
    silent on Windows, where every caller invokes the interpreter explicitly
    and never exercises the bit. The mirror's own release CI catches it
    (`.github/scripts/check-exec-bit.py`) — this makes the pipeline stop
    producing what that gate exists to reject.

    The predicate is deliberately the GATE's predicate, not a source-mode
    comparison: matching `check-exec-bit.py` exactly (index mode `100644` +
    blob opening `#!`) is what makes a green run here mean a green run there,
    and it needs no dest-path-to-source-path mapping. It is also correct
    where the two disagree — `coordinator/bin/percolate-mirror.py` and
    `coordinator/bin/statusline.py` are shebanged and `100644` in claude-klabauter's own
    index today, so a source-mode copy would faithfully propagate the defect.

    Converges, and is cheap once converged: an entry already at `100755` stays
    there across later `git add`s under `core.fileMode=false`, so steady state
    is two git calls that find nothing.

    Batched by construction — one `ls-files`, one `cat-file --batch`, one
    `update-index` over every offender — never a call per path
    (`coordinator_core/tests/test_no_unbatched_per_item_git_spawn.py`).

    SCOPED TO `scope_dirs`, never the whole index, for the same reason
    `_dirty_paths_under` is: the caller's commit pathspec covers exactly these
    subtrees, and a mode change staged OUTSIDE them is one no pathspec picks
    up — it would sit staged-uncommitted and leave the mirror permanently
    dirty, tripping the next round's dest-cleanliness precondition. Fixing a
    mode this run cannot also commit is worse than leaving it to the run whose
    scope does cover it.

    """Commit each destination repo's synced bytes, once, at the successful
    conclusion of a percolation. Returns `True` when every destination either
    committed or had nothing to commit.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. A bare `coordinator-publish` run used to exit 0 with
    every gate green and leave the mirror holding its own certified output as
    uncommitted changes. `percolate-round` then refused on its dest-
    cleanliness precondition, naming `--reconcile-dest=discard` as the
    remedy — which resets the mirror to HEAD and destroys exactly those
    certified bytes. Committing here is what makes "dest is dirty" mean
    "a predecessor crashed" again, which is the only thing that precondition
    was ever meant to detect.

    COMMIT, NOT PUBLISH (PM ruling, 2026-08-19). This step ends at a local
    commit. It never pushes a branch and never merges — publishing the mirror
    stays a separate deliberate act, named for the operator by `main()`'s
    per-dest `percolate-push` nudge (§ "Percolate-push next-step nudge"),
    not by this function.

    That is enforced by `push_mode=PUSH_MODE_NEVER`, which skips the
    pipeline's own push leg AND stands the `post-commit` hook's detached push
    down, so no publisher pushes this commit on any branch.

    It used to be enforced by neither. This function passed the default
    `push_mode="sync"` and relied on the push leg's `work/*`-only branch
    policy (`push_with_retry` -> `auto_push.branch_gate`) declining, because
    a publish mirror sits on `candidate`/`main`. That produced the right
    outcome for a reason unrelated to the requirement: the mirror was
    unpublished because of how its branch happened to be NAMED, so renaming
    it to `work/*` — or relaxing that policy for any reason of its own —
    would have turned every percolation into a publication, silently and
    with nothing in this file to catch it. A side effect is not a safeguard;
    the mode is (2026-08-21, PM: "there shouldn't be an auto-push ... the
    percolation should end in a commit and then suggest publishing with
    another button press").

    Calls `coordinator_core.git.commit.commit_paths` in-process (`ceremony.
    commit_v2`'s own in-process call, mirrored here rather than round-tripped
    through the op registry -- this driver already runs in-process) --
    repointed off the killed `run_commit_pipeline` (C4, docs/plans/2026-08-29-
    the-push-subsystem-leaves-and-then-the-pipeline-can-go.md), the same
    shape `execute_plan_assemble.close_out_and_stamp` and `ops.session.
    safe_commit_offer` were repointed onto by the same plan. No push leg at
    all: this loop never owned a synchronous push, publication stays a
    separate deliberate act per this function's own "COMMIT, NOT PUBLISH"
    section above.

    Negative-spec: NOT called under `--dry-run`, NOT called when any row
    failed, and NOT called when an end-of-run gate failed — a gate failure
    means this run's published bytes are unverified (AC15 fail-closed), and
    committing unverified bytes would hand the next round a clean dest that
    certifies nothing.

    Negative-spec: does NOT run when `percolate-round` drives the publish
    (it passes `--no-commit`). The round owns its own
    commit -> CI-smoke -> push sequence (DR-301) and moving the commit ahead
    of its CI smoke would reorder that contract.

    A missing subdirectory *inside a real git repo* is a virgin mirror that
    has simply never received this row — safe and expected to create, so it
    bootstraps. A missing directory with NO `.git` ancestor means the
    destination sigil resolved to nowhere (unset registry key, wrong clone
    path, typo); that must fail loudly rather than let `mkdir(parents=True)`
    fabricate a whole tree in the wrong place and report success. Flat-mirror
    rows previously bootstrapped unconditionally, which is exactly that hole;
    mirror rows previously refused unconditionally, which hard-skipped every
    row of a freshly created mirror repo until a human mkdir'd by hand.

    An EXISTING `dest_dir` that has no other `.git` ancestor above it (i.e.
    this row's `dest_dir` is itself supposed to BE the repo root — the
    toplevel row, no `dest_subdir`) but also carries no `.git` of its own is
    a DEGRADED destination, not a virgin one: some earlier run's swap left
    content behind without its repo metadata (§
    `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest`'s `PublishSwapPartial`). That must also
    fail loudly rather than silently treat stray content as ready to publish
    back over.

    DoE synthesized a broken mirror and drove the ladder against it
    (`DoE-claude coordinator/tests/test_engine_root_degraded_mirror_outcomes.py`,
    `be3dec68b027`, five cases, mutation-tested): a clean consumer box hits
    `unresolved`/root `None` -- a LOUD failure, not wrong bits. A MIXED
    machine (a consumer repo alongside a reachable live checkout) is the
    only one of the five shapes that silently falls through to the live
    working tree instead -- that fallback is NOT the general behaviour of
    every consumer, only of that mixed-machine shape. An engine-working repo
    never consumes the published engine at all, so it cannot bite either way.
    `_prepublish_projection.py` records `coordinator/percolate/` "observed
    absent on the 2026-08-12-registered claude-klabauter mirror" and falls
    through today, so the degraded state this guard closes is real, not
    theoretical.

    A test proving what a degraded mirror DOES (their fixture above) is not
    a guard preventing publish from CREATING one -- different doors, which
    is why this still ships against their fixture rather than being
    satisfied by it.

    This closes the PUBLISH-TIME path only. NAMED RESIDUAL, not solved
    here: a session can be mid-turn when someone runs `git checkout` in the
    mirror outside a publish, and under whole-box dogfooding a promotion
    (`klabauter-promote.py`) IS a checkout event -- the same silent fallback
    to the live working tree, arriving through a door this guard does not
    cover. See docs/reference/klabauter-release-channels.md's "Named
    residuals" section (C11's live-ops preflight is a partial mitigation,
    not a fix).

    SCOPE, corrected post-review (state/subagent-share -- coordinatorcode-
    reviewer-e094bd79.md, two P1s): DoE's own evidence for this guard is a
    REGISTERED mirror going degraded ("the 2026-08-12-registered claude-
    klabauter mirror") -- `resolve_engine_root()`'s downstream consumers only
    ever reach a dest through the `publish.mirrors.*` registry, so a dest
    this row's registry has no entry for is never on that path at all and
    the check is out of scope for it, same rationale C9
    (`assert_dest_on_declared_ref`) already applies via
    `_publish_mirror_key_for_repo_root`. Without this, EVERY mirror row --
    a docs mirror, a flat toplevel mirror, an unregistered test/ad-hoc dest
    -- was refused merely for lacking a `coordinator_core/` it was never
    meant to have.

    SCOPE, second narrowing (cross-repo memo 2026-08-16-doe-claude-em-
    engine-guards-block-coordinator-claude-publish.md): registration alone
    is still too wide -- `coordinator_claude` (`publish.mirrors.
    coordinator_claude`, path per `machine-local get publish.mirrors.
    coordinator_claude.path`) IS a registered mirror and is DELIBERATELY
    engine-free by design (the doctrine-only OSS mirror; it has never
    carried `coordinator_core/`), so all 5 of its rows refused under the
    registration-only predicate -- 0/5 rows succeeded.
    Registration answers "does a declared registry entry exist for this
    dest", not "does this mirror carry the engine payload"; those are
    different facts and only the second one is what this guard is FOR.
    Narrowed again to `_engine_declaring_mirror_keys()`: a registered
    mirror's key is in scope for this guard IFF the portable topology
    itself writes `coordinator_core` into it somewhere (the `claude-
    klabauter` row does; no `coordinator_claude` row does). Derived rather
    than a THIRD registry key (`declares_engine`) an operator would have to
    remember to set -- "the operator remembers" is not an artifact, and a
    derived-from-data predicate is self-maintaining against the same rows
    that already declare klabauter's payload. Default is `False` (not
    declaring), so an engine-free mirror is never judged on an absence that
    defines it, and this second narrowing is itself scoped BENEATH the
    first: an unregistered dest still short-circuits above without ever
    reaching this check.

    POST-WRITE, not just current state: a dest whose OWN `coordinator_core/`
    is exactly what THIS row's write is about to populate (source already
    carries it) must not be judged on its pre-write absence -- that is a
    virgin-dest false refusal, not a degraded mirror. `target.dest_dir ==
    engine_root_dir` already covered the "this row IS the coordinator_core
    row" shape; `target.source_dir / "coordinator_core"` covers the same
    row-writes-the-payload-directly shape when the dest nests it one level
    down. A sibling row (bin/scripts/lib) whose OWN write never touches
    `coordinator_core/` still correctly reads CURRENT state -- its write
    can't make coordinator_core appear or vanish, so "does it exist right
    now" is the right question for it; a true first-ever multi-row bootstrap
    ordering gap (an entrypoint row runs before the emitter row has ever
    written coordinator_core once) is a NAMED RESIDUAL, not solved here --
    same posture as the residual above, and out of scope per the "do not

    at what is actually in `staging_dir` (§ its `_went_unstaged`) rather than
    calling this — an observation cannot drift from, or race, the decision it
    observes, and two earlier attempts to share a derivation here did both.

    Both conditions below are load-bearing:

      * root-dest rows only. A `dest_subdir` row's swap renames staging ONTO
        the destination, so declining to stage a name there would destroy it
        rather than preserve it; such a row is staged in full and must be
        reported in full.
      * directories only. The root-dest swap DOES unlink a top-level FILE
        absent from staging, so a file carrying one of these names is staged
        normally — and therefore has to be reported normally too.

    with a copy of `dest_dir`'s current on-disk content (`.git` excluded),
    for a staged publish row's sync/sweep/guard/inject/pre_ci phases to run
    against instead of the real destination.

    Same filesystem as `dest_dir` by construction
    (`tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=dest_dir.parent)`) — `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest`'s
    `os.rename` calls are only cheap, atomic-as-the-OS-provides metadata
    operations when source and destination share a volume; an unqualified
    `tempfile.mkdtemp()` would resolve to the system temp dir, frequently a
    different one, and turn the swap into a full copy (or a POSIX/Windows
    cross-device `OSError`) exactly at the moment this fix is supposed to
    make cheap and safe.

    `.git` is deliberately excluded from the copy: `sync_mirror`'s own
    top-level orphan sweep already skips top-level dotfiles/dot-directories
    (state/audits' orphan-sweep invariant), so no phase this staging tree
    feeds ever needs `.git` present, and copying a repo's full history on
    every publish row for content this fix never reads would be a severe,
    unbounded cost with no correctness benefit. `.git` is never moved into
    this staging tree either (not at creation, not at swap time) — it rides
    with `dest_dir` straight into `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest`'s
    `prior_backup`, untouched, and is re-homed into the new `dest_dir` only
    after the content swap has already landed. This keeps `.git` out of the
    tree every early `return`/exception before the swap discards via
    `_discard_publish_staging_dir` — a doomed directory should never hold a
    repo's only copy of its own history.

    A provisioned fleet environment (`.fleet-env/`, plus its `.prior`/`.gen-*`
    siblings — § `_FLEET_ENV_STAGING_SKIP_RE`) is excluded on exactly the same
    grounds as `.git`, and measured far larger: a live toplevel run copied
    9.6GB of vendored site-packages into staging, swept every file of it for
    depersonalization, compared it byte-for-byte via `_dir_trees_equal`, and
    then deleted the copy — four full passes over content no phase this tree
    feeds ever reads. That is the "severe, unbounded cost with no correctness
    benefit" the `.git` paragraph above names, in a bigger tree.

    Two constraints make the exclusion safe, and BOTH are load-bearing:

      * TOP-LEVEL ONLY. The ignore callable returns early unless the directory
        being walked IS `dest_dir`, so a nested path that happens to carry one
        of these basenames is copied normally. `shutil.ignore_patterns` cannot
        express this — it matches at every level — which is why this is a
        callable rather than another pattern argument.
      * ROOT-DEST ROWS ONLY, gated on `(dest_dir / ".git").exists()` — the SAME
        predicate `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest` uses to pick its root-dest
        branch, so the exclusion is exactly co-extensive with the branch that
        tolerates it. That branch swaps per top-level entry and never removes a
        directory from `dest_dir` (§ `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest_root`'s
        "Top-level DIRECTORIES are never removed here"), so an excluded
        directory is simply left in place, untouched. The whole-tree branch
        renames `staging_dir` ONTO `dest_dir`, where the same exclusion would
        destroy the environment instead of preserving it — hence the gate. A
        `dest_subdir` row's `dest_dir` never holds a `.git`, and no fleet-env
        has ever lived anywhere but a repo root, so this is belt-and-braces on
        both sides rather than a live discrimination; keep it anyway.

    `dest_dir` not yet existing (a virgin publish row, § `_ensure_dest_ready`'s
    bootstrap leg already having created it as an empty dir by the time this
    runs) yields an all-but-empty staging dir — correct, there is no prior
    content to seed it with.

    Orphan-on-partial-copy guard: `mkdtemp` and `copytree` are two separate
    steps, and this function only returns a path on FULL success. A raise
    from `copytree` partway through (permission error on one file, a
    concurrent mutation of `dest_dir` mid-copy — this machine routinely runs
    50-70 concurrent sessions, § `docs/wiki/machine-load-norm.md`) used to
    propagate straight out of this function before the `return` — the
    caller's `staging_dir = _create_publish_staging_dir(...)` assignment
    then never completes, so `process_target`'s own `staging_dir` local
    stays `None` and its `finally` block's `_discard_publish_staging_dir`
    call is a no-op (guards on `is not None`), permanently orphaning the
    already-`mkdtemp`'d, partially-copied directory with no reference left
    anywhere to reclaim it on a later run (unlike the `.prior` shape, which
    at least gets refused-on-detection next time). This function now cleans
    up its OWN `mkdtemp`'d directory before re-raising, so a caller either
    gets back a fully-seeded staging dir or nothing is left behind at all —
    the cleanup rmtree runs through `_rmtree_clear_readonly_onerror`, which
    clears a Windows read-only attribute and retries, so a read-only copied
    file cannot leave the directory only partially removed the way a bare
    `ignore_errors=True` would.

    one behind (the fix at commit 56c0303d7 only stops NEW orphans; it does
    nothing for ones already on disk). Called once per row, before that
    row's own `_create_publish_staging_dir`, so a stale directory never sits
    around as untracked cruft in `dest_dir`'s parent, indistinguishable from
    real publish payload in a `git status` someone might build a commit
    pathspec from.

    Glob is deliberately the exact `_create_publish_staging_dir` mint shape,
    scoped to `dest_dir.parent` only — never a broader pattern, never another
    destination's directory. `.prior` directories (§
    `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest`'s stranded-`.git` guard) are a DIFFERENT
    lifecycle with their own refuse-on-detection handling at swap time and
    are explicitly excluded here — this sweep must never touch that mechanism.

    Liveness discriminator: directory MTIME age, not a PID/liveness check.
    `mkdtemp` requires no PID bookkeeping and this glob has no reliable way
    to recover which process (if any) owns a candidate directory — a PID
    file would be another thing to get wrong under `kill -9`, and a stale
    PID reused by an unrelated process would falsely read as live anyway.
    Age is simpler and portable (pathlib/shutil only, no shell-out, no
    per-OS process-liveness API). `max_age_seconds` defaults to one hour,
    and the live-but-slow case is safer than "an hour of wall-clock row
    time" alone suggests: `shutil.copytree` (§ `_create_publish_staging_dir`)
    creates entries directly under `staging_dir` as it runs, and the OS
    refreshes a directory's own mtime on every entry creation within it —
    so a genuinely live, merely-slow concurrent copy keeps re-stamping
    `staging_dir`'s mtime for as long as it keeps creating files. This sweep
    only misfires on a live row if the directory itself goes a FULL HOUR
    between successive file-creation events, not merely if the row's total
    runtime exceeds an hour. Every observed publish row still completes in
    low single-digit minutes even at the machine's 1000+-file end of the
    size range, so the margin is wide either way.

    `dest_dir.name` is `glob.escape`d before interpolation: an un-escaped
    `*`/`?`/`[...]` in the name would let the glob under- or over-match
    against the exact literal prefix `_create_publish_staging_dir` mints
    with `tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix=...)` — this sweep deletes directories in
    a publish destination, so the match set must stay exact. The trailing
    `*` wildcard is appended after escaping and must keep its glob meaning.

    A sweep failure (permission error, concurrent removal, a transient
    holder) is logged via `warn` and this function returns — it must never
    fail the publish it is trying to keep tidy.

    `dry_run=True` keeps discovery/age-filtering intact but skips the
    `shutil.rmtree` at the removal site, printing what would have been
    swept instead — `dry_run` gates every other write in this file
    (Finding 1, s3-sweep-and-dirty review) and this is the sweep's own
    mutation, not row disposition, so it must obey the same gate without
    losing C3's row-disposition-independent placement."""

    Could not reach: `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest` delegates to the
    root-dest branch and RETURNS before the whole-tree refusal below it ever
    runs. Both publish mirrors are repo roots, so both take that branch and
    neither has ever been offered a stranded-prior check.

    Could not match: the whole-tree refusal globs `dest_dir.parent` for
    `.{dest_dir.name}.publish-staging-*.prior` and predicates on a `.git`
    inside the candidate. `_swap_publish_staging_entry` mints
    `<entry>.prior` INSIDE `dest_dir` and never moves `.git` (it is not in
    `staging_dir` at all), so a root-branch strand matches neither the glob
    nor the predicate. `surface.PUBLISH_STAGING_DIR_RE` does not match it
    either -- no surface walk, manifest widening or pathspec filter sees one.

    WHAT IT COSTS TO GO UNSEEN, which is why this is a refusal and not a
    warning. `_swap_publish_staging_entry` renames `dest_entry` aside to
    `<entry>.prior`, then renames `staging_entry` into place; the restore
    sits in an `except OSError` and so covers a failed rename but NOT a
    SIGKILL, OOM or host reboot between the two. A death in that window
    leaves a whole top-level subtree gone from the worktree, its content in
    an untracked `<entry>.prior`, and every one of its files still tracked at
    dest HEAD -- which is exactly the three conditions percolate-round's
    removal side reads as a stranded removal (`(head_tree n row_scope) -
    declared_payload`). `_refuse_removals_present_on_disk` cannot catch it:
    those paths are genuinely absent. The per-entry loop reopens the window
    once per top-level entry per round.

    THIS REOPENS A RULING THAT CUT A RETRY HERE, ON THAT RULING'S OWN STATED CONDITION.
    `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest`'s docstring records a bounded retry removed on PM
    ruling 2026-08-10 (staff-eng finding 5), and names what would reopen it: "a single
    observed `PermissionError` with `winerror` 5 or 32 from these renames in a real run."
    That is what happened -- `PermissionError(13)`, winerror 5, `prior_backup_rename`,
    recorded in `state/audits/publish-swap-refusals/20260902T183923.956093Z-60636.json`.
    The shape below is the one that ruling prescribed, not a fresh design.

    OWNERSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED FIRST, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT RULING.
    `state/lessons/2026-08-07-a-retry-over-a-resource-error-hides-whet-e31057280e2b.yaml`
    (2026-08-07) is the case it came from: a retry was added for an "antivirus race" that
    was really a lock sidecar THIS process held open inside the destination `.git` for the
    whole run -- unclearable by any amount of waiting, and the retry cost a diagnosis cycle
    by making a deterministic failure look intermittent. Two facts separate this occurrence
    from that one. The sidecar lives under `<dest>/.git/coordinator-locks/`, and a handle
    there cannot block renaming its SIBLING `coordinator_core`, so the known self-held cause
    is excluded by path rather than by assumption. And the holder was caught directly: a
    20ms-interval probe of the exact access a rename needs recorded the directory HELD with
    `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` for 21ms and free on all 589 other samples, at a moment when
    no round of this process was running. External, demonstrated, not inferred.

    NEGATIVE SPEC -- THIS RETRIES CONTENTION AND NOTHING ELSE. `PermissionError` only, never
    a blanket `except OSError`: `FileExistsError`/`NotADirectoryError`/`IsADirectoryError`
    are permanent and would just be retried pointlessly. Discrimination is on `.winerror`,
    never `.errno` -- CPython maps both Windows codes to `EACCES`, so `.errno` cannot tell
    them apart. On timeout the LAST exception is re-raised unchanged, so the caller's own
    refusal record and its `failing_operation` label are exactly what they were before this
    function existed -- a genuinely wedged destination still refuses, no less loudly.

    A FUTURE FAILURE HERE IS STILL RE-DIAGNOSED, NOT RE-MITIGATED. This function absorbs a
    brief external holder; it is not evidence that any future `PermissionError` on these

    `dest_dir` IS a repo root (§ that function's docstring for the
    detection and the tradeoff this branch accepts). Never renames
    `dest_dir` itself — instead swaps top-level names one at a time via
    `_swap_publish_staging_entry`, so a live handle held anywhere under a
    SIBLING row's subtree (another `claude-klabauter*` row's own subdir, or
    a coordinator ceremony interpreter running out of this same live
    engine install) can never block this row's own publish the way a
    whole-tree rename of the repo root can on Windows.

    Add/update: for each top-level entry in `staging_dir`, swap it into
    `dest_dir` — except a directory whose content already matches `dest_dir`
    byte-for-byte per `_dir_trees_equal` (an untouched sibling-row copy;
    § that function's docstring) is left alone entirely, not even
    renamed-aside. `.git` is never a candidate here: `_create_publish_
    staging_dir` never copies it into `staging_dir` in the first place.

    Removal: a top-level FILE present in `dest_dir` but absent from
    `staging_dir` is deleted, matching what a whole-tree replace would
    have discarded — `staging_dir` is a full copy of `dest_dir` taken
    before this row's own sync/transform pipeline ran (§ `_create_
    publish_staging_dir`), and nothing else ever mutates this staging_dir
    instance, so a file that vanished from it was deliberately removed by
    THIS row's own processing (e.g. `sync_flat_mirror`'s own "not in
    source" deletion phase, which already runs against this same staging
    copy — see `process_target`'s `sync_target = replace(target,
    dest_dir=staging_dir)`). `.git` is excluded from this walk explicitly
    (belt-and-braces; it was never in `staging_dir` to begin with, so it
    could never be flagged as absent-from-staging regardless).

    Top-level DIRECTORIES are never removed here: `staging_dir` is seeded
    as a full recursive copy of `dest_dir` (§ `_create_publish_staging_
    dir`), so a directory present in `dest_dir` before this call is always
    still present in `staging_dir` too (untouched or updated) — it can
    never be "absent from staging", so no directory-removal case exists to
    preserve. This is a real asymmetry with the subdir-row whole-tree path
    (which discards an entire missing directory the same as a missing
    file), accepted because this row's actual dispatch mode
    (`sync_flat_mirror`) never manages directories at all (file-only, by
    that function's own Phase 1/2 split) — a hypothetical future root-dest
    row in a directory-managing mode would need this reconsidered, and
    should say so rather than silently relying on this note.

    Never touches `.git/coordinator-sessions/` (nested under `.git`,
    already excluded) or any other entry the row does not own; ownership
    for the add/update leg is exactly "named in `staging_dir`" — never

    """Replaces `dest_dir`'s content with the fully-verified content of
    `staging_dir` (§ `_create_publish_staging_dir`) — the ONLY point in a
    staged publish row where the real destination is ever mutated, reached
    only after sync + the content-transform sweep + its guards + inject +
    pre_ci have all already succeeded against `staging_dir`.

    Root-dest branch (`dest_dir` IS a repo root — detected via `(dest_dir /
    ".git").exists()`, the same signal `_ensure_dest_ready` already uses to
    distinguish a toplevel row's own `.git` from a `dest_subdir` row's
    ancestor `.git`; a `dest_subdir` row's `dest_dir` never holds `.git`
    directly, only an ancestor does, so this check cannot false-positive on
    one): delegates to `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest_root` and returns
    immediately, BEFORE any of the whole-tree steps below ever run. On
    Windows, renaming a directory fails with a sharing violation if ANY
    process holds an open handle ANYWHERE in that subtree — for a repo-root
    `dest_dir` that subtree is the union of every sibling row's own output
    plus a live engine install's `.git`/`.git/coordinator-sessions/`
    interpreters, so the single `os.rename(dest_dir, prior_backup)` below
    can essentially never succeed for that row (`claude-klabauter-publish-
    repo-toplevel`, diagnosed via `WinError 32`/`PermissionError(13, ...)`).
    The root branch trades whole-tree swap atomicity for PER-ENTRY
    atomicity to make that rename avoidable at all — a `dest_subdir` row
    keeps the stronger whole-tree guarantee unchanged below; only the
    root-dest row takes the weaker, entry-scoped one. This tradeoff is
    deliberate, already decided, not open for re-litigation here.

    That branch also makes step 3 below (the `.git` re-home) and the
    `PublishSwapPartial` stranded-`.git` raise UNREACHABLE for the only row
    that could ever hit them: `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest_root` never
    touches `.git` at all (it is never copied into `staging_dir` — §
    `_create_publish_staging_dir` — and this function's root branch
    explicitly skips the name `".git"` in both its add/update and removal
    legs), so no `.git`-bearing `prior_backup` is ever created for that row
    under the new code, and the stranded-`.prior`-with-`.git` refuse-loudly
    guard at the top of this function (below) is also never reached for it
    (the root branch returns before that check runs). A pre-existing
    stranded `.prior` from a run of the OLD code cannot exist for this row
    either: the diagnosis established this row's root `os.rename(dest_dir,
    prior_backup)` always failed on Windows (the mirror root's files carry
    stale mtimes from before this fix), so `prior_backup` itself was never
    successfully created historically. Verified against the code, not
    assumed: the only remaining caller of step 3 / `PublishSwapPartial` is
    a `dest_subdir` row, which never has a `.git` of its own to strand in
    the first place (§ this docstring's own prior paragraph on seven of
    eight rows carrying a `dest_subdir`) — so in practice this class is now
    dead for every row, kept only because a hypothetical row shape this
    driver does not currently declare could still reach it.

    `.git` is deliberately NOT pre-moved into `staging_dir` before the swap.
    It rides with `dest_dir` into `prior_backup` untouched, and is re-homed
    into the new `dest_dir` only afterward, if one was there to move — this
    keeps `.git` out of the doomed tree that every early `return`/exception
    in `process_target` discards via `_discard_publish_staging_dir`. Refusing
    to pre-move also means step 3 below is a NO-OP on most rows: seven of
    `setup/publish-targets.portable`'s eight `claude-klabauter*` rows carry a
    `dest_subdir`, so `dest_dir` is never a repo root and never holds a real
    `.git`; only the `-publish-repo-toplevel` row does. Refuse-on-stranded-
    `.prior` guard: before any rename, refuse loudly if a `.prior` directory
    from an earlier, incomplete swap of this same destination already exists
    and still holds a `.git` — see the guard block below. `dest_dir.name` is
    `glob.escape`d before interpolation here too (§
    `_sweep_stale_publish_staging_dirs`, same rationale): an un-escaped
    `*`/`?`/`[...]` in the name would let this guard's glob under- or
    over-match against the exact literal `.prior` directories a real swap
    mints. The trailing `*.prior` suffix is appended after escaping and must
    keep its glob meaning.

    Every rename below is same-filesystem (`staging_dir` was created via
    `tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=dest_dir.parent)`), so each is a metadata-only
    operation on every OS this driver supports, never a full-tree copy. The
    prior `dest_dir` is renamed aside rather than deleted outright, and only
    reclaimed after `staging_dir` has successfully taken its place — this
    keeps the window in which the destination NAME resolves to neither tree
    as small as a single `os.rename` call, on both POSIX and Windows (neither
    of which supports atomically renaming onto an existing, non-empty
    directory, so the aside-then-remove sequence is the portable shape, not a
    POSIX-only single rename).

    Sequence and the state after a raise at each step:
      1. `dest_dir -> prior_backup` (only if `dest_dir` exists). A raise here
         leaves `dest_dir` untouched — nothing to unwind.
      2. `staging_dir -> dest_dir`. A raise here is caught, `prior_backup` is
         restored to `dest_dir` (now a COMPLETE repo, `.git` included, since
         `.git` rode along in step 1), and the exception is re-raised.
      3. `prior_backup / ".git" -> dest_dir / ".git"`, only when
         `prior_backup` exists AND holds a `.git` (i.e. only on the
         repo-toplevel row). A raise here is the one genuinely new state:
         content is already current at `dest_dir`, but `.git` is still sitting
         in `prior_backup`. This is NOT swallowed and NOT bare-re-raised — it
         is wrapped in `PublishSwapPartial`, naming `prior_backup`'s concrete
         path so an operator can finish the `.git` re-home by hand.
         `process_target` catches it, records the swap as having happened
         (content DID change), and re-raises so the row still reports FAILED.
      4. `shutil.rmtree(prior_backup, ignore_errors=True)`, reached only on
         full success.

    Accepted residual risk — an external transient holder (antivirus scan,
    search indexer) on any of these renames is not mitigated here, and that is
    deliberate. A bounded retry once wrapped all three; it was removed because
    the `PermissionError` it was added for came from a handle THIS process held
    for the whole publish (the per-destination lock sidecar, then living under
    `<dest>/.git/coordinator-locks/`), which no amount of retrying could ever
    clear. The retry did not fix that and did delay its diagnosis by a full
    cycle. A future `PermissionError` here should therefore be re-diagnosed
    from first principles — find whose handle it is — never answered by
    restoring a blind retry.

    A shape that WAS considered and cut, kept here as the shape to reach for
    IF an external holder is ever actually demonstrated (not assumed): catch
    ONLY `PermissionError`, discriminating on `.winerror in (5, 32)`
    (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED / ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION) — never on `.errno`
    (CPython maps both Windows codes to `EACCES`, so `.errno` cannot tell them
    apart) — and never a blanket `except OSError` (`FileExistsError` /
    `NotADirectoryError` / `IsADirectoryError` are permanent and would just be
    retried pointlessly). Bounded tightly, well under a second total, given
    the machine's 50-70 concurrent sessions. Cut on PM ruling 2026-08-10,
    staff-eng finding 5: eliminating the known self-held cause (above) is not
    the same as demonstrating an external one. Condition that would change
    this ruling: a single observed `PermissionError` with `winerror` 5 or 32
    from these renames in a real run — cite
    `state/lessons/2026-08-07-a-retry-over-a-resource-error-hides-whet-e31057280e2b.yaml`
    by file and date, not paraphrase, if reopening this. This sits ALONGSIDE
    the "re-diagnose from first principles" warning above, not instead of it.

    REOPENED 2026-09-02 ON THAT EXACT CONDITION — the paragraph above is kept
    verbatim because its reasoning still governs, but its closing sentence ("No
    retry is added here") no longer describes this function. The renames below
    now go through `_rename_with_retry`, in the shape this paragraph prescribes:
    `PermissionError` only, discriminated on `.winerror`, bounded well under a
    second. The triggering observation is
    `state/audits/publish-swap-refusals/20260902T183923.956093Z-60636.json`
    (winerror 5, `prior_backup_rename`); the ownership work that had to come
    first, and why the self-held lock sidecar is excluded by path here, is in
    `_rename_with_retry`'s own docstring. The re-diagnose-first-principles
    warning above is NOT retired by this and applies to the next failure."""

    one refactor the plan names ("have that function return what it already
    computes").

    This is the ONLY point a staged publish row's change report is honest:
    the sync dispatch (`sync_manifest`/`dispatch_mirror_like`) that ran
    earlier against `staging_dir` necessarily compared raw, untransformed
    source bytes against a staging seed that already carried the PRIOR
    run's post-transform output (§ `_create_publish_staging_dir` — staging
    is seeded from a copy of `dest_dir`), so for any row with a copy-time
    transform (fleet-only strip, or the engine's post_rsync content-
    transform sweep: substitute/stem-rewrite/depersonalize/basename-rename)
    that early comparison mismatches BY CONSTRUCTION on every run, whether
    or not the published bytes actually changed. Callers therefore run the
    sync dispatch against a throwaway `RunTotals`/quiet `out` (see
    `process_target`) and rely on THIS function, called immediately before
    `_swap_publish_staging_into_dest`, for the real report — `staging_dir`
    here already reflects sync + the content-transform sweep + its guards +
    inject + pre_ci, i.e. exactly what is about to be published, and
    `dest_dir` is still the untouched prior tree.

    `.git` is excluded from both sides: staging never carries one (§
    `_create_publish_staging_dir`), and `dest_dir`'s copy is publish
    machinery, never payload this row's report should count.

    The fleet-env family (§ `_FLEET_ENV_STAGING_SKIP_RE`) is excluded from the
    `dest_dir` side for the SAME structural reason, and the exclusion is NOT
    optional bookkeeping. Anything `_create_publish_staging_dir` declines to
    stage is, by construction, present in `dest_dir` and absent from
    `staging_dir`, so `set(dest_files) - set(staged_files)` would report every
    one of its files as a REMOVE. Measured on a live toplevel row: 95,256
    phantom REMOVE lines, a ~9MB log, and `totals.deleted` inflated by the
    same, for a tree the swap never touches
    (`_swap_publish_staging_into_dest_root` removes top-level FILES only).

    Not a cosmetic report defect, which is why it is pinned by tests rather
    than left to the reader: `percolate-round.py::_extract_change_lines`
    parses these exact `NEW:`/`UPDATE:`/`REMOVE:` lines to build the pathspec
    it hands `scoped-git-commit`. An unexcluded fleet-env puts ~95k paths into
    a commit pathspec, asking git to record the deletion of a gitignored
    multi-GB environment that nothing deleted.

    `_went_unstaged` OBSERVES that outcome rather than recomputing it: a
    top-level name is excluded iff it matches the family pattern AND is
    absent from `staging_dir`. Two earlier attempts re-derived the answer
    from `dest_dir` instead, and both were wrong in a way this shape cannot
    be:

      * The first dropped `_create_publish_staging_dir`'s root-dest and
        directories-only conditions, so a `dest_subdir` row (which stages the
        family in full) and a top-level FILE (which is staged deliberately,
        since the swap unlinks top-level files absent from staging) both read
        as phantom `NEW:`. Presence in `staging_dir` answers both without
        restating either condition.
      * The second restored those conditions but scanned `dest_dir` a second
        time, minutes after the copy, opening a TOCTOU window (review:
        code-reviewer on 97f0a5830): this machine runs 50-70 concurrent
        sessions, one of which provisioning a fresh `.fleet-env.gen-<pid>-
        <hex>` in that gap yields a directory staged in full but excluded
        from the dest walk — phantom `NEW:` again. A directory that appears
        after the copy is simply absent from staging and is excluded; one
        that was staged is present and is reported. No window.

    The rule to preserve is therefore "the report reflects what staging did",
    never "the report re-derives what staging should have done".

    That rule has a residual requirement `_went_unstaged` does not enforce on
    its own: it hard-codes `_FLEET_ENV_STAGING_SKIP_RE` as one leg of its AND,
    and today that agrees with `_create_publish_staging_dir`'s `_ignore`
    closure only because `_ignore` derives its exclusion set from the same
    regex (§ `_fleet_env_unstaged_names`). Any future copy-side exclusion
    added to `_ignore` that does not also match `_FLEET_ENV_STAGING_SKIP_RE`
    — a hardcoded literal, say — would be excluded from staging while
    `_went_unstaged` still returned `False` for it, reopening the phantom-
    `REMOVE:` defect this function exists to close.

    dest-relative, both sides exactly as `_report_published_diff`'s own
    `NEW:`/`UPDATE:`/`REMOVE:` lines are), on the same stdout channel, so
    the sibling change-line parser in `percolate-round.py`
    (`_extract_change_lines`) can resolve a pathspec entry that is a
    rename SOURCE to its rename TARGET (§ that module's docstring, AC7's
    commit-pathspec provenance invariant, and the originating plan's C1/C2).

    `rename_manifest` is the `RenameManifest.as_records()` wire shape (a
    list of `{old_path, new_path, kind}` dicts, § `dispatch_percolate_
    post_rsync`'s docstring) — NOT the older flat `{old_path: new_path}`
    dict this used to accept. Each `RENAME:` line now carries its entry's
    `kind` as a `RENAME[directory]:` keyword PREFIX tag, printed only for a
    directory-kind entry — a file-kind entry's line is BYTE-IDENTICAL to
    what this printed before the wire carried `kind` at all, since `'file'`
    is both the default kind and the only kind that ever existed before
    directory renames did) so `percolate-round.py`'s own `_RENAME_LINE_RE`
    parser can reconstruct a real `RenameManifest` and call `.resolve()`
    instead of an exact-key dict lookup that can never match a path
    beneath a renamed directory (docs/plans/2026-08-14-publishing-runs-
    itself.md § C1 — the defect this fix closes).

    A no-op when `rename_manifest` is `None` or empty — a row with no
    renames must produce byte-identical output to today (§ the originating
    plan's C1 body). Never called under `--dry-run`: the dry-run leg never
    dispatches `dispatch_percolate_post_rsync`, so it never has a manifest
    to report, and inventing one there would resurrect the cried-wolf class
    docs/plans/2026-08-11-dry-run-cries-wolf-on-the-rename-exemption.md
    just closed.

    Spec backlink: pln-the-publish-round-commits-the-fa5df4
    § Tasks C1, Acceptance Criteria AC1.

    Review: coordinator:code-reviewer — the kind tag is printed as a
    `RENAME[directory]:` PREFIX, not a trailing ` [directory]` suffix on
    the path, because a suffix is a position a real `new_path` can occupy
    (a path literally ending in ` [directory]` would be misparsed as
    directory-kind) and a trailing tag is silently swallowed by an
    un-upgraded reader's old regex as part of the captured path. A prefix
    can never be forged by path content, and an old `_RENAME_LINE_RE`
    anchored on the bare `RENAME:` form simply fails to match a tagged line
    of corrupting the path it extracts. File-kind lines are unchanged
    (still bare `RENAME:`) to stay byte-identical to pre-existing output.

    publish.py and percolate-round.py are one wire contract for this
    tag and must be upgraded together in the same commit — an old
    percolate-round.py cannot parse a `RENAME[directory]:` line at all
    (it degrades to not-matching, never to a corrupted path; see
    `_RENAME_LINE_RE`'s own docstring note).

# `publish-mirror:claude_klabauter` rows in `setup/publish-targets.portable`
# split one argv contract across independently-landing rows: `claude-klabauter`
# (source `coordinator_core`) COMPOSES argv and hands it to the five

# is internally inconsistent for its whole duration; the direction of that
# window matters. A parser row landing ahead of an emitter that later adds a
# flag parses fine (harmless, for additions only); an emitter row landing
# ahead of its parser exits 2 before running (the 2026-08-15 live incident
# the plan's § Problem records). `setup/publish-targets.portable` therefore

    NEGATIVE SPEC — every prune below is load-bearing, none is tidiness:

    - `surface.STRUCTURAL_NEVER_PUBLISHED_PREFIXES` — `.git`, `.fleet-env` and
      kin: destination-repo plumbing, never publish-owned content. A
      flat-mirror row's `dest_dir` IS the mirror root (`LICENSE` and
      `.gitignore` sit in `declared_payload` today), so an unpruned walk names
      thousands of git objects as declared payload. `declared_payload` drives
      the ADD side of `percolate-round.py :: _pathspec_from_manifest`, so they
      reach the commit leg, which declines every one — and a non-empty
      `declined_paths` refuses the round's push outright (§
      `_round_refusal_reason`). Unpruned, this widening breaks every future
      round rather than merely costing a slow walk.

      A HAND-ROLLED `(".git", "__pycache__")` TUPLE STOOD HERE AND WAS NOT
      ENOUGH, measured on klabauter 2026-08-26: the first post-AC2 manifest
      carried 48,929 declared paths, of which **44,264 were `.fleet-env/`** —
      the multi-GB build tree the mirror's own `.gitignore` excludes. That is
      not merely bloat. `declared_payload` is SUBTRACTED from `row_scope` in
      the removal derivation, so over-declaring silently disables the removal
      side: the dry run reported 0 candidates while the same round warned that
      1 removal went uncarried. An over-wide declaration reads as a clean pass,
      which is the failure shape this whole deliverable exists to close.
      Reusing the SSOT — which already names `.fleet-env`, `.fleet-env.prior`,
      `.fleet-env.gen-*` and `.percolate` — is what makes the prune list
      unable to drift from the one every other walk in this system uses.
    - `surface.PUBLISH_STAGING_DIR_RE`: a crashed round's scratch, which no row
      declares. 1,028 files of one reached the public mirror in round
      `eebf1c67`; letting this walk re-declare one would reopen that incident
      through the back door.
    - `__pycache__`/`.pyc`/`.pyo`: generated locally AT the destination by
      anything that runs Python there, published by no row (§
      `publish_sync._is_structural_build_artifact`, same vocabulary).

    Each prune reuses the SSOT the rest of this system already walks on; none
    introduces a fresh exclusion vocabulary."""

    alone to distinguish these four outcomes, without parsing the "Rows
    succeeded"/"Rows FAILED" summary or scanning stdout for FATAL text —

      0 — every requested row's bytes landed (or, under --dry-run, every row
          previewed cleanly) AND, on a real run, every end-of-run
          verification gate (identity/install-doc/unscanned-published/
          function/entrypoint) passed.
      1 — at least one row's bytes did NOT land (raised mid-row, or was
          declined by a pre-sync gate) — "Rows FAILED" names it. Fires under
          --dry-run too: a previewed row can fail its own preconditions
          (e.g. an allowlist-build failure) independently of --dry-run, and
          this driver must never claim success while reporting FAILED rows.
      2 — every requested row's bytes landed, but a POST-publish
          verification gate failed — distinct from 1 on purpose: this is
          "bytes landed, verification incomplete," never "bytes did not
          land." Never fires under --dry-run (those gates never run there).
      3 — every requested row's bytes landed AND every gate passed, but the
          end-of-run COMMIT of a destination repo did not complete (§
          `_commit_published_dests`). Distinct from 2 for the same reason 2
          is distinct from 1: the bytes are published and verified, and what
          is outstanding is only that the mirror is still dirty — the state
          the next `percolate-round` reads as a crashed predecessor. Never
          fires under --dry-run, nor under `--no-commit`.

    Previously (both directions confirmed live, see the bug-backlog entry):
    --dry-run unconditionally returned 0 even when rows were reported
    FAILED, and an end-of-run gate failure returned the same code (1) as a
    row failure, making the two indistinguishable from the exit code alone.
