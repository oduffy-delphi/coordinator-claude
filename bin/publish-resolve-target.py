"""coordinator/bin/publish-resolve-target.py — thin CLI over
lib/percolate/resolve_target.resolve_publish_row.

Usage:
  publish-resolve-target.py <raw_row>

Port of: resolve-publish-target.sh (DoE 16302166, 2026-07-21) — preserves its
sourced-function contract exactly: one pipe-delimited row on stdout on
success, diagnostics on stderr, exit codes 0/1/2/3 (see
lib/percolate/resolve_target.py's module docstring for the full contract —
these codes are the CLI's return codes too).

Port: docs/plans/2026-07-21-percolate-python-port.md (chunk C-W0).

Cwd-independent: this script self-bootstraps its own `sys.path` (bin/../lib)
before importing `percolate.resolve_target`, so it requires no DOE_ROOT
injection or particular working directory from callers invoking it as a
subprocess.
