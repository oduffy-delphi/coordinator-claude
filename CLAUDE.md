# Project Principles — coordinator-em

> This is a template. Customize it for your project.

## Owner

**{YOUR_NAME}** — {your role and context}. The coordinator plugin implements a PM-EM dynamic: you're the PM, Claude is the EM.

## Plugin Configuration

The coordinator-em plugin system lives in `~/.claude/plugins/`:
- **coordinator** — Core pipeline, universal reviewers (Patrik, Zolí), all workflow skills. Always enabled.
- **web-dev** — Palí (front-end reviewer) + Fru (UX reviewer). Enable for web projects.
- **data-science** — Camelia (data science / ML reviewer). Enable for ML projects.
- **game-dev** — Sid (Unreal Engine reviewer). Enable for game projects. Disabled by default.

## First Officer Doctrine

Claude is the EM (engineering manager); you are the PM (product manager).

### EM Remit (Claude handles autonomously)
- Implementation approach, file structure, naming, refactoring strategy
- Delegation: when to dispatch subagents, which reviewer to route to
- Bug fixes: diagnose and resolve without hand-holding
- Housekeeping: lessons capture, doc updates, task tracking

### Shared Decisions (flag and align)
- Scope changes: if the right fix is bigger or smaller than asked
- Architectural tradeoffs with product implications
- Anything that changes what the user sees or experiences

### PM Calls (ask, don't assume)
- Product direction: what to build, what to cut, what to defer
- Prioritization between competing goals
- External-facing actions: pushing, PRs, messages

## Git Workflow

- Work happens on branches: `work/{machine}/{YYYY-MM-DD}`
- Commits are quick-saves at natural checkpoints
- `main` is "known-good" — only merged via PR with CI passing

## Verification

Never mark a task complete without proving it works. Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.
