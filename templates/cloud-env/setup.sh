# Cloud-environment setup script — SPIKE. Paste into "Setup script" at claude.ai/code.
#
# PURPOSE: land coordinator-claude and its engine on an Anthropic-managed cloud VM BEFORE Claude
# Code launches, without touching the claude.ai-hosted plugin surface at all. It registers the
# plugin from a `directory` marketplace source in user settings, so the top-level-bin/ ban
# (claude-ai-hosted-plugin-constraints.md) never applies on this route — nothing is uploaded, no
# admin approval surface is involved, and no `claude` binary is needed at setup time.
#
# REPO-AGNOSTIC BY DESIGN, AND THAT IS THE POINT. This is pasted into a cloud ENVIRONMENT, which is
# the OPERATOR's surface at claude.ai/code — not a file in any repo and not a step any repo's own
# installer has to adopt. Everything it needs it clones itself, so the same paste works for a
# session on any repo. A sibling team wanting the coordinator layer in their cloud sessions needs
# no change on their side; the operator configures their environment with this.
#
# ONE EXCEPTION, LIVE TODAY: doctrine (phase 3b)'s third candidate is a published copy that, as of
# this writing, may not yet be in the plugin mirror. Status, verification commands, and what a
# session sees if it isn't there: README.md § Known gap, beside this file. Don't restate that state
# here — it is truth-expiring and README.md is its one home.
#
# PASTE THIS ALONGSIDE — the "Environment variables" box, which reaches the SESSION but NOT this
# script (which is why every value below is also hardcoded here):
#
#     COORDINATOR_SETTINGS_HOME=/root/.coordinator-claude-settings
#     COORDINATOR_ENGINE_ROOT=/opt/coordinator/claude-klabauter
#
# If the report below says HOME is not /root, or /opt was not writable, change both to match the
# ROOT= line this script printed — they must name the paths it actually used.
#
# It always exits 0. A non-zero exit fails the whole session, so every finding is a FAIL line to
# read in the setup checklist, never a boot abort. Phase 0 is the probe — it reports the facts a
# developer host cannot establish, and it runs first so its answers are on record even when a later
# phase fails.
#
# SCOPE, budget, snapshot/re-run semantics, and the verification record: README.md beside this file.
