_resolve_claude_klabauter.py — shared resolve-claude-klabauter-bin ladder, extracted from
``coordinator_core.install.substrate._write_agent_forwarder``'s
formerly-inline-per-forwarder body.

Every emitted bin forwarder used to carry its own copy (~50 lines) of the
registry-then-sentinel resolution ladder that locates
``<claude-klabauter-root>/coordinator/bin/`` and validates it before exec'ing into a
target CLI there. With the forwarder SET now derived from a directory
listing (rather than a hand-maintained ~10-entry tuple — see
``substrate.py``'s ``_derive_agent_helper_names``), that duplication would
have scaled to ~127+ near-identical copies of the same ladder. This module
is installed ONCE (alongside every emitted forwarder, in the same shim
dir — settings-home ``bin/`` and the ``~/.claude/bin`` compat mirror) and
imported by each forwarder's now-trivial ~6-line body.

Contract preserved verbatim from the prior inline body (DoE-claude
``coordinator/snippets/resolve-claude-klabauter-bin.md``, DoE commit ``ad7fb0d1``):
registry-key-then-sentinel resolution rungs, ``coordinator/bin`` composition,
the ``..``-traversal guard, on-disk existence checks for the resolved root
and ``coordinator/bin``, an *executable* sentinel probe (``archive-stamp-cli``),
and distinct fail-loud messages for the two on-disk failure modes (wrong/
incomplete checkout vs. stale/partial migration).

Deliberately does NOT carry the ``_cc_trusted``/``.doe-root`` trust-prefix
dance the prior template never carried either — this seam's trust posture
differs from ``cc-root-source-guard``: ``registry.local.toml`` and
``.claude-klabauter-root`` are per-machine, gitignored, operator-authored config under
the operator's own settings-home, not a harness-supplied value an external
actor can steer. What this module DOES check — because a typo'd or stale
config value is a real, non-adversarial failure mode, not a trust boundary —
is exactly the four checks enumerated above.

Review: code-reviewer — sanctioned path-load consumer surface. Underscore-
prefixed names below (``_ml_dir``, ``_registry_value``,
``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root``) are NOT general-purpose public API — this module's
only stable contract for arbitrary callers is
``resolve_claude_klabauter_root_with_class()``, the ``RESOLUTION_*`` constants, and
``resolve_claude_klabauter_bin_dir()``/``exec_cli()``. The ONE declared exception:
``coordinator_core.engine_root`` (loaded BY PATH, never imported as a
package — see that module's own docstring) is a named path-load consumer of
``_ml_dir``, ``_registry_value``, and ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root`` directly, in
its hot-path short-circuit that skips the full
``resolve_claude_klabauter_root_with_class()`` ladder when ``repos.claude_klabauter``
is not registered. Changing ``resolve_claude_klabauter_root_with_class()``'s step-1
precondition (the published-engine-registered-and-usable check) obliges
updating that wrapper's short-circuit in the SAME change — see
``coordinator_core/engine_root.py``'s matching declaration, and
``coordinator_core/tests/test_engine_root_two_tier.py``'s cross-entrypoint
agreement test (fixture: ``repos.claude_klabauter`` absent) for the
mechanical backstop that catches drift here.

C7 naming-retirement note
(docs/plans/2026-08-19-an-engine-root-is-a-stamped-build.md § C7,
docs/reference/engine-vs-locator-resolver-routing.md): C7 decided the fate
of the publish-time ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root`` -> ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root``
rename transform is to KEEP it, not retire it — it still functions as a
useful tripwire (a symbol that exists only post-publish, so a caller
accidentally importing the pre-publish name fails loud instead of silently
resolving the wrong tree). C7 also bucketed every caller of the
``_resolve_claude_klabauter``-symbol family across the tree by priority order into a
routing table (the doc above) rather than hand-triaging each one.

Naming note: this module's ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root(ml_dir)`` above and
``coordinator/bin/lib/cc_invoke.py``'s module-level ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root()``
are UNRELATED functions that happen to share a name — this one resolves
``repos.claude_klabauter`` (the SOURCE TREE / claude-klabauter repo location, the exact
"dangerous name" collision the PM's naming ruling calls out), cc_invoke's
resolves the ENGINE (dispatch axis, delegated through the DR-132/stamp
gate). This one is already the "source-tree resolver, confined to a named
narrow seam" C7's body asks for in substance — underscore-private, and its
only declared exception consumer is ``coordinator_core.engine_root``'s
path-load (see the Review note above) — but is NOT renamed to say so in
this pass: that consumer path-loads it BY THIS NAME, so a rename here
requires updating that consumer in the same change, and
``coordinator_core/engine_root.py`` is outside this chunk's ``writes:``
scope. Left as a named exception, not a silent skip.

# --- publisher-only targets: never resolvable from the published engine ----
#
# ``resolve_claude_klabauter_root_with_class()``'s divert (C5) sends any session whose
# own repo root is not the live claude-klabauter checkout to the published engine
# mirror. For nearly every forwarded target that is correct — the mirror
# carries a complete, stamped engine build. For the percolate publish
# family it is not, and cannot be made so: the mirror is the PUBLISH
# DESTINATION, and the modules these targets dispatch against
# (``coordinator_core.percolate.*``, ``coordinator_core.ops.percolate_run``)
# are publisher-side only and deliberately absent from it — see
# ``state/bug-backlog/2026-08-11-klabauter-mirror-ships-the-ops-registry-287f6526da3a.yaml``.
# Their FILENAMES are published (C13 closed the per-name gap so a missing
# target means a broken install rather than a known hole), so the divert
# resolves, the sentinel probe passes, the target file exists — and the run
# then dies on an import that can never succeed there. ``--dry-run`` returns
# before that import, so it reports clean and reads as clearance.
#
# These targets therefore resolve LIVE-TREE-ONLY, via ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root``
# (the single-tier ladder ``resolve_claude_klabauter_bin_dir`` uses), and fail loud
# naming the publisher when it misses. Publishing FROM the published copy is
# not a thing that can work, so there is no second root to try.
#
# MEMBERSHIP RULE — publish-DENIED, not percolate-importing. The percolate
# family above is the loudest instance of the class, never its definition.
# The rule is: a ``coordinator/bin/*.py`` name on the
# ``claude-klabauter-coordinator-bin`` row's ``deny`` list in
# ``setup/publish-allowlist-declarations.yaml`` is never published at all, so
# a session diverted to the mirror finds no target under EITHER spelling and
# dies at C13's fail-loud 127 naming a root that could never have carried it.
# That remediation cannot be acted on: the file is not missing from a broken
# install, it is absent by declaration. Five names were publisher-only by that
# rule while the earlier import-token reading admitted only the percolate
# five — ``check-persona-slug-leak``, ``coordinator-validate-local-config``,
# ``engine-gap-lint``, ``percolate-push`` and ``publish-time-transform-py``
# each shipped a forwarder that diverted and died. Deny is the CAUSE; the
# percolate import is one symptom of it.
#
# Do NOT read the mirror on disk to decide membership. The mirror is a build
# artifact and may be any vintage; the declarations yaml is the authoring
# input that decides what a round ships, and it is the same answer on a box
# with no mirror at all.
#
# Hand-maintained here because this module is installed standalone into a
# bare ``bin/`` with only the stdlib importable (see the module docstring) —
# it cannot read the declarations yaml or import the engine to derive the set.
# Drift is caught instead by
# ``coordinator_core/install/test_resolve_claude_klabauter_publisher_only.py``, which
# re-derives the set from that ``deny`` list and fails when the two disagree,
# in BOTH directions. That guard is what makes the next omission impossible
# rather than merely unlikely: adding a bin CLI to ``deny`` without adding it
# here turns the suite red.

# The advisory above reports a CONFIGURATION (you ran the mirror, not your
# tree) and deliberately not a vintage. That left the harm unaddressed: a
# session against a stale mirror produces work that silently does not take
# effect, which is what this plan's own authoring burned six cross-session
# messages on.
#
# WHY THIS DOOR MAY NOT COMPUTE IT. `warm.skew.publish_lag` costs 15.6ms of
# process time / 99.3ms wall (measured k=5, 2026-08-28) and two git spawns,
# and this module is on the interpreter floor of EVERY coordinator invocation
# on a box carrying 50-70 concurrent sessions. It is also forbidden to import
# `coordinator_core` at all. So the verdict is computed by the post-commit
# path -- which runs on the event that invalidates it and already pays for git
# -- and read here for 0.078ms (measured k=200).
#
# TWO POPULATIONS, TWO ANSWERS, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT AXES:
#
#   Box WITH a claude-klabauter checkout: "N commits behind" is computable, and the
#   cache carries it. The key is (source HEAD sha, engine stamp text); a
#   verdict whose key does not match what this door observes is ABSENT, never
#   a lower-confidence answer.
#
#   Box WITHOUT one -- the population that diverts in the first place: the
#   commit count is not computable by ANYTHING here. `publish_lag` resolves
#   the stamp sha against the source history, and that sha is not present in
#   the mirror's own history (`git cat-file` rc=128, measured 2026-08-28). The
#   only vintage fact that population holds is when the round ran, which
#   publish emits as `_engine_published_at`.
#
# NEGATIVE SPEC -- AN AGE IS NOT A WEAK STALENESS MEASURE, IT IS A DIFFERENT
# QUESTION, and the two come apart in BOTH directions: a mirror published
# three days ago is current if nothing engine-touching landed since, and one
# published five minutes ago can be six commits behind. So the published-at
# line MUST say which axis it is on. A signal that gets read as the other axis
# is the failure this whole plan exists to remove.
#
# NEGATIVE SPEC -- do NOT read the timestamp off the stamp file's mtime, and
# do NOT fold it into `_engine_stamp`. mtime does not survive a copy, rsync,
# clone or archive extract -- every one of which is how a mirror arrives on a
# checkout-free box. And `skew.read_engine_stamp_sha` silently returns a
# CORRUPT sha for both an inline and a second-line extension of the stamp
# (measured), which takes the currency signal dark rather than wrong.

# box." One declared fact, box-wide, two values. No per-repo axis exists to
# SET this — ``engine.working_repos`` (above) remains a per-repo LOCATOR
# (which repos are working trees to divert away from), a different axis
# entirely; C4 retires its exemption duty but this fact never grows one of
# its own.
#
# Registry key: ``engine.target`` (nested ``[engine] target = "..."`` or the
# flat quoted-dotted-key form ``machine-local set`` writes), read via
# ``_registry_value`` — registry.local.toml (per-machine override) wins over
# the tracked registry.toml baseline, first-hit-wins, identical precedence to
# every other declared fact this module reads.
#
# HARD CONSTRAINT (memo-invalidation): this key MUST live in one of the two
# files ``_registry_mtime_pair`` (coordinator_core/engine_root.py) already
# stats -- registry.toml or registry.local.toml -- so that writing it
# self-invalidates both ``_ROOT_MEMO`` and ``_GATE_MEMO`` by mtime with no
# explicit reset call. ``_registry_value`` reads exactly those two files, so
# this constraint is satisfied by construction; do not move this fact to a
# new sentinel file, a settings-home JSON, or an env-only var -- any of those
# would sit outside the stat tuple and make a rollback silently ineffective
# for every process that has already resolved. ``_reset_root_memo()`` is a
# test-only seam with zero non-test callers -- it is not the rollback
# mechanism; the mtime pair changing IS the mechanism.
#
# NEGATIVE SPEC: this is NOT a channel axis on the resolver's ladder above --
# ``resolve_claude_klabauter_root_with_class()`` still resolves a PATH, and this
# declaration does not touch it, ``resolution_class``, or the conformance
# schema. The target fact is a declared value for resolution/diagnostics
# callers (C8+) to consume later, never a per-call ref check spliced into the
# ladder here.

    that prohibition is superseded, not merely violated; see DR-132's/

    an unstamped tree is never a legitimate answer to "which engine
    executes" — ``_resolve_published_engine`` denies an unstamped published
    root outright (C5), and C4 already removed the live-tree ref-based

    single-tier, live-tree-only, deliberately un-flipped; see its own
    docstring and DR-326.

    Returns ``(root, resolution_class)`` where the class is one of
    ``RESOLUTION_RESOLVED_ENGINE``, ``RESOLUTION_LIVE_WORKING_TREE``, or
    (only via a raised ``ClaudeKlabauterResolutionError`` — see below)
    ``RESOLUTION_UNRESOLVED`` never actually returned by this function today,
    since the terminal miss raises rather than returning a sentinel tuple;
    it is exported for callers building their own class-comparison logic.

    Ladder:
      1. A published engine registered/usable AND ``engine.target`` is
         readable (AC20: presence/readability only — its VALUE is never
         inspected here, same as DoE's own reader) AND the structural gate
         (``_is_claude_klabauter_source_tree`` — is THIS session inside the engine's
         own resolved source tree?) returns literally ``False`` (a
         CONFIRMED not-the-source-tree session, not an undeterminable one)
         -> ``(published, RESOLUTION_RESOLVED_ENGINE)``.
      2. Otherwise today's existing ladder (``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root``:
         registry key -> ``.claude-klabauter-root`` sentinel) -> if it resolves,
         ``(root, RESOLUTION_LIVE_WORKING_TREE)``.
      3. Otherwise, if a published engine is registered/usable ->
         ``(published, RESOLUTION_RESOLVED_ENGINE)``.
      4. Otherwise re-raise the ``ClaudeKlabauterResolutionError`` step 2 raised —
         "the existing" error, its remediation text now extended (see
         ``_resolve_claude_klabauter_root``) to also mention ``repos.claude_klabauter``.

    2026-08-18 (C4): step 1's discriminant used to be per-repo
    ``engine.working_repos.*`` set membership (``_is_engine_working_repo``,
    retired). PM ruling: a per-repo exemption family cannot express a
    box-wide choice. The structural check that replaced it answers the same
    question ("is this session the engine's own source, or does it fall
    through to the published mirror") without a membership list — you
    cannot develop the engine while running a different copy of it, which is
    a structural fact about THIS session's root vs. the ONE resolved claude-klabauter
    root, not a per-repo exemption. Consequence, deliberate: a session in
    any OTHER repo (doe-claude, project-rag, ...) now diverts to the
    published engine where it may not have before, even if that repo
    happens to be listed under ``engine.working_repos.*`` (that key remains
    a pure LOCATOR for other callers — see ``setup_chain_walker.py`` — it is
    simply not this gate's input any more).

    ``engine.target`` GATES the divert too (AC20, ruling correction

    via a PATHEXT-suffixed sibling, which is what ``CreateProcess`` actually
    execs).

    Negative-spec — this MUST NOT become
    ``from coordinator_core.win_portability import is_executable``, at module

    return its intended exit code.

    Every ``coordinator/bin/`` CLI is a plain ``.py``-shaped module (some
    extensionless, some ``.py``-suffixed — see ``substrate.py``'s
    ``_write_agent_forwarder`` docstring) whose body is either a bare script
    or the ``if __name__ == "__main__": sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))``
    pattern (e.g. ``archive-stamp-cli``). ``runpy.run_path(...,
    run_name="__main__")`` is the portable stdlib primitive that executes a
    plain file path as if it were run as ``__main__`` — no shebang
    interpretation needed (unlike ``os.execv`` on Windows, which goes
    through ``CreateProcess`` and cannot honor ``#!`` lines), no second
    interpreter cold-start, and no module-registry entry required for a
    target this function has no static import path for (targets are
    resolved dynamically by filename, not by package name).

    ``sys.argv`` is swapped for the duration of the call (restored in
    ``finally``) because target scripts read ``sys.argv`` directly (as
    ``archive-stamp-cli`` does) rather than accepting an injected argv
    parameter — this is the in-process equivalent of what ``execv``/
    ``subprocess`` would otherwise set up via the child's own process argv.

    TWO entries are inserted at the FRONT of ``sys.path`` for the duration of
    the call — *claude_klabauter_root* and the target script's OWN directory — restored
    (never merely popped — a target is free to mutate ``sys.path`` itself) in
    the same ``finally`` as ``sys.argv``.

    Why both: ``runpy.run_path`` on a plain FILE path contributes NOTHING to
    ``sys.path``. It prepends only for a directory or zipfile argument; a
    ``.py`` file is executed in a throwaway namespace with ``sys.path``
    untouched. An earlier revision of this docstring asserted the opposite —
    that ``run_path`` supplies ``<claude_klabauter_root>/coordinator/bin`` — and that
    false premise is why the script-dir insert was missing here. Do not
    re-derive it: verified against CPython, a file-path ``run_path`` leaves
    ``sys.path`` byte-identical.

    So a normal ``python target_path`` invocation (the POSIX leg of
    ``exec_cli``) gets the script's directory for free from the interpreter's
    own startup and needs neither insert; this leg gets neither and needs
    both. Without *claude_klabauter_root*, a target doing ``import coordinator_core`` at
    module scope dies with ``ModuleNotFoundError`` before running a line of
    its own logic. Without the script directory, so does every target built on
    ``entry_point_shim`` — ``from lib.entry_point_shim import run_target``
    resolves ``lib`` relative to ``coordinator/bin``, which nothing else puts
    on the path (observed live: ``sizing-assemble`` on the Windows in-process
    leg, ``No module named 'lib.entry_point_shim'``).

    The root the caller already resolved (``resolve_claude_klabauter_root_with_class``
    et al.) is reused here, never re-resolved. Idempotent per entry: an entry
    already present is skipped, so a target that itself re-enters this
    function (or is invoked from a process that already has either directory
    on ``sys.path``) never accumulates duplicates.

    A target that calls ``sys.exit(n)`` raises ``SystemExit(n)`` through
    ``run_path`` exactly as it would run standalone; that is caught here and
    its ``.code`` propagated (``None`` and non-int codes normalize to 0/1
    per Python's own ``sys.exit`` contract, mirrored here rather than
    reinvented). A target that falls off the end without calling
    ``sys.exit`` completes with implicit success (0), matching normal
    process-exit semantics.

    Negative-spec: the POSIX leg of ``exec_cli`` (interpreter-targeted
    ``os.execv``) needs none of this — a fresh interpreter process resolves
    its own ``sys.path`` from ``target_path``'s directory the normal way,
    and this function is never called on that leg. Do not add a ``sys.path``
    insert there; it would be a no-op on a process image this function never
    touches.

    *bin_dir*, consulting publish's rename map when the asked-for name misses.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Publish applies an identity transform to filenames:
    `check-claude-klabauter-doctor-sentinel.sh` ships as
    `check-claude-klabauter-doctor-sentinel.py`. The installed forwarder body
    is `exec_cli("check-claude-klabauter-doctor-sentinel.sh")` -- verbatim, the claude-klabauter
    spelling -- so on a box diverted to the published engine the target is
    absent under the only name asked for, and the run dies at C13's fail-loud
    127 naming a root that does, in fact, contain the program. The transform
    renamed the file; nothing renamed what the forwarder asks for.

    The mapping cannot be inferred. Three of the four live renames look like a
    `claude-klabauter` -> `claude-klabauter` token rewrite, but
    `probe-cwd-project-rag-relevance.py` ships as
    `probe-cwd-example-retrieval-repo-relevance.py`, which is derivable from
    nothing. One counter-example makes inference wrong for the whole set
    rather than incomplete on one member, so the map is SHIPPED by the process
    that performs the rename and merely read here.

    LOOKUP IS BY DIGEST (§ `_published_name_map_key`). The map's keys are
    sha256 of the source basename, never the basename itself, because the
    source spelling is exactly what the mirror's identity scrub removes -- a
    literal-keyed map fail-closes the publish route on the residual-pattern
    leak check and never reaches a mirror at all.

    WHY THE MAP SHIPS IN THE MIRROR RATHER THAN WITH THE INSTALLED DOOR, the
    alternative considered and declined (2026-09-02): delivering it alongside
    the door would also keep banned tokens out of the mirror, and the source
    spellings are already on the box in the forwarder bodies, so it leaks
    nothing new. It was declined on VINTAGE. This map describes what ONE
    published mirror actually contains; shipping it with the installer couples
    it to the installer's vintage instead, so a mirror republished under a
    changed rename table leaves an install-time map describing names that are
    no longer there. In the mirror, the map is by construction the vintage of
    the tree it maps. The stale-map case degrades rather than lying (the
    `os.path.isfile` check below returns the original path), but degrading is
    the 127 this whole mechanism exists to remove.

    Negative-spec, in order of how easily each would be got wrong:

    - Callers must invoke this ONLY for `RESOLUTION_RESOLVED_ENGINE`. A
      live-tree miss is a genuinely broken checkout and must keep failing
      loudly per C13; a rename map has no business rescuing it, and there is
      no map in a live tree to read anyway.
    - This does NOT widen `PUBLISHER_ONLY_TARGETS` and must never be made to.
      The publisher-only class and the renamed class share a symptom and take
      INVERSE repairs: publisher-only targets exist nowhere but the live tree,
      so pinning them there is right; renamed targets ship and work and are
      merely misaddressed, so pinning them live-tree-only would break them on
      every box without a checkout -- the population that currently has them
      working.
    - Returns the ORIGINAL path when anything is missing or unreadable: no
      map, unparseable map, name absent from it, or a mapped name that is not
      on disk. The caller then fails exactly as it does today. An absent map
      means "no mapping known", never an error -- most mirrors carry no map
      until a round has run since it was introduced.
    - Reads the map only on the MISS path. A target that resolves under its
      own name never opens this file, so the ordinary case pays nothing.

    ``_write_agent_forwarder`` docstring), so there is no "genuinely
    unimportable target class" requiring a spawn fallback: this process is
    already running Python, so the fix is to run the target **in-process**
    via ``_run_target_in_process`` (``runpy.run_path``) instead of shelling
    out to a second one. This removes the interpreter-resolution failure
    mode entirely — there is no longer a "no Python interpreter found on
    PATH" case, because no second interpreter is ever located or started.

    Negative-spec (POSIX mechanism) — interpreter-targeted ``execv`` was
    chosen over in-process ``runpy.run_path`` (the same primitive the
    Windows leg uses) for the POSIX leg too. Measured on one warm macOS
    box, 12 runs each, both orders, pessimistic reading: status quo
    ``os.execv(target_path, ...)`` 32.6ms; interpreter-targeted execv
    31.3ms; in-process 20.2ms. In-process was rejected despite being
    fastest because it abandons process identity and couples forwarder and
    target process state permanently — specifically, ``runpy.run_path``
    from a forwarder leaves the FORWARDER's directory at ``sys.path[0]``
    rather than the target's, breaking bare sibling imports that
    direct-script invocation handles. Interpreter-targeted execv runs the
    target as ``python target_path``, which CPython treats identically to
    today's shebang-invoked script for ``sys.path[0]``, ``sys.argv[0]``,
    ``__file__``, signal disposition, and traceback shape — this is why the
    POSIX leg does NOT collapse onto ``_run_target_in_process``.

    On a resolution failure, writes the distinct fail-loud message to
    stderr and exits 1 (matching the prior inline body's contract). On a
    missing (or unreadable — see the `os.access(os.R_OK)` pre-check below)
    *target* itself (partial install, mid-refresh tree, or a name-map entry
    pointing at a stale target), exits 127 (POSIX command-not-found
    convention) with a one-line remediation. Non-executable is no longer a
    127 case: the interpreter-targeted POSIX mechanism below runs the
    target as `python target_path`, not target_path directly, so the exec
    bit is never required.

    C4b (RETIRED by C13) — per-target existence gate on the published-engine
    rung. Root resolution goes through `resolve_claude_klabauter_root_with_class()`
    (C3's two-tier ladder) rather than the single-tier
    `resolve_claude_klabauter_bin_dir()`, so this function can see WHICH class
    answered. A directory-level sentinel probe (`resolve_claude_klabauter_bin_dir`'s
    `archive-stamp-cli` check) passes against the published mirror even
    though the claude-klabauter-vs-published forwarder sets were NOT nested when C4b
    landed (C4a's oracle: 20 names live-tree-only, 5 published-only on that
    tree) — the gap was per-target, so C4b's gate fell back to the live
    working tree (via the single-tier `resolve_claude_klabauter_bin_dir`) and exec'd
    the target from there when it existed, only failing loud (127, naming
    both roots tried) if that ALSO missed.

    C13 (docs/plans/2026-08-19-an-engine-root-is-a-stamped-build.md § C13):
    that fallback is REMOVED. C13 first closed the measured per-name gap
    (published-engine `coordinator/bin/` allowlist vs. the installed-name ->
    on-disk-target map `_derive_agent_helper_target_map` resolves against —
    see `setup/publish-targets.portable`'s `claude-klabauter-coordinator-bin`
    row) — once the published set carries every name the live tree does, a
    missing target under a resolved published-engine root is no longer "a
    known gap the live tree covers", it is a genuinely broken install. A
    missing *target* under EITHER resolution class now fails loud (127)
    naming only the ONE root actually tried — there is no second root to
    silently reach into any more.

    PUBLISHER-ONLY CARVE-OUT. A *target* in ``PUBLISHER_ONLY_TARGETS`` skips
    the class-aware ladder entirely and resolves live-tree-only, via
    ``_resolve_publisher_root``. This is not an exemption from C13's
    fail-loud rule — it is upstream of it: for these targets the published
    engine is the publish DESTINATION, so it is never a legitimate root, and
    diverting there yields a target that exists and then dies on an import
    that cannot succeed. Everything else is unchanged, byte-for-byte, on
    both legs. Negative-spec: do NOT "generalize" this into a fallback that
    tries the published engine when the live tree misses — a publish round
    run from the published copy is not a degraded round, it is not a round.
