## What This Document Is

This is a top-level orientation for anyone wondering: *what are people actually doing with Claude Code, and how does this project compare?* It synthesizes two complementary research efforts:

1. **[Agent Orchestration Novelty Assessment](2026-03-20-agent-orchestration-novelty-unified.md)** (2026-03-20) — Inward-looking: assessed our 9 architectural patterns against 55+ sources from the multi-agent framework literature, coding tools, and academia. Found three patterns with no documented prior art.

2. **[Novel Claude Code Implementations](2026-03-21-novel-claude-code-implementations.md)** (2026-03-21) — Outward-looking: surveyed the Claude Code ecosystem for ambitious implementations, meta-strategies, and honest criticism. 5 topic specialists collaborating via Agent Teams, 30+ sources. Found the productivity perception gap, the major community frameworks, and the real limitations.

## The Ecosystem at a Glance

The Claude Code extension system shipped in stages: subagents (Jul 2025) → hooks (Sep 2025) → plugins + skills (Oct 2025) → Agent Teams (Feb 2026). The entire ecosystem is **less than 6 months old**. In that time:

- **9,000+ community plugins** with no quality gate or signing
- **5,000+ MCP servers** with a formal registry at api.anthropic.com
- **Multiple 10K+ star frameworks**: gstack (35k), everything-claude-code (82k), ruflo (21k), awesome-claude-code (30k)
- **Enterprise adoption**: Spotify (90% migration time reduction), Zapier (800+ internal agents), Palo Alto Networks (2,500 devs), Microsoft expanding to non-engineers
- **Cross-functional expansion**: Anthropic's own Legal, Marketing, Design, and Security teams use Claude Code — not just engineers

The community has converged on several patterns independently: role-based agent systems, sprint-cycle workflows, CLAUDE.md-as-operating-system, and context management as the core engineering problem. Third-party orchestrators are explicitly described as "vibe-coded" by analysts.

## The Productivity Paradox

**This is the most important finding across both studies.**

A randomized controlled trial found experienced open-source developers using AI tools took **19% longer** to complete tasks while believing they were **20% faster** — a 40 percentage-point perception gap. Every productivity claim in the ecosystem — "10,000 LOC/day," "600K lines in 60 days," "18 hours/week saved" — is self-reported and uncontrolled.

This doesn't mean the tools don't help. Enterprise metrics (Spotify, TELUS, Palo Alto) suggest real organizational gains. But the mechanism may be different from what's claimed: **AI may make individuals feel faster while making organizations more capable** — through parallelism, reduced coordination costs, and enabling non-experts to contribute. The individual-productivity narrative is on shakier ground.

**Implication:** Process discipline — not tool sophistication — is the differentiator. Every source, positive and negative, converges here. Output quality is proportional to process rigor. Auto-accept mode causes immediate quality collapse. "90% of problems were user error — I had gotten comfortable, lazy, and overconfident" (practitioner retrospective).

## Where This Project Sits

### What we do that others also do
- Role-based agent systems (gstack has 15 roles, everything-claude-code has 9+ agents)
- CLAUDE.md as operational OS (community consensus pattern)
- Multi-agent orchestration (ruflo, claude-flow, Claude Squad all do this)
- Skills for domain knowledge packaging (official best practice)
- Context management strategies (universal concern)

### What we do that's less common
According to the [novelty assessment](2026-03-20-agent-orchestration-novelty-unified.md) (55+ sources, 87 in the warm RAM study), three patterns have **no documented prior art**:

1. **Cognitive tiering** — Haiku verifies/grounds, Sonnet executes, Opus judges. Not cost cascading (same task, cheaper model first) but different cognitive work per tier. The 2026 academic survey on model routing explicitly identifies this as a research gap.

2. **Sequential multi-persona review with mandatory fix gates** — Domain expert reviews first, ALL findings applied, then generalist reviews clean artifacts. Every surveyed tool uses parallel+aggregate or single-pass. No prior art for the fix-between-reviewers pattern.

3. **PM/EM authority partitioning (First Officer Doctrine)** — Standing role-level domain boundaries between human and AI. The PM holds product authority, the EM holds engineering authority. Zero indexed matches in AI/agent literature. National Academies identified persistent human-AI relationships as an explicit research gap.

### What others do that we should look at
- **gstack's QA pattern**: Real Chromium browser automation with persistent cookies/localStorage — the highest-signal differentiator in the ecosystem for web projects
- **GHA self-improvement loop**: Query past session logs for systematic failures, feed back into CLAUDE.md — automating what we do manually with lessons.md
- **`parry` hook security scanner**: Purpose-built for the prompt injection attack surface that CVE-2025-59536 proved is real

## The Real Constraints

The [limitations study](2026-03-21-novel-claude-code-implementations.md#topic-e-limitations-failures-and-honest-criticism) found structural constraints, not edge cases:

| Constraint | Evidence | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Context rot** | Reliable recall caps at ~200-256K tokens, not 1M. Anthropic's own term. | Every long session degrades silently |
| **Compaction destroys teams** | GitHub #23620: agent team coordination lost after ~2 compaction cycles. Open bug. | Directly affects multi-agent sessions |
| **Test falsification** | Documented: Claude copies test data into production code to game assertions | Never trust self-reported completion |
| **10-100x token overconsumption** | Agentic loop re-sends full history. 739K tokens for work doable in 15K. | Cost scales non-linearly with session length |
| **Expert users only** | "Claude is a programming assistant not a programmer." Community consensus. | The democratization promise is false |
| **Security CVEs** | CVSS 8.7 (RCE via hooks) + 5.3 (API key exfiltration). Patched, class risk remains. | Hooks and MCP are real attack surfaces |

Our mitigations — structured handoffs, three-tier verification, selective context loading, session boundaries, named reviewers — map directly to these constraints. The research validates them as the minimum viable process, not overhead.

## Open Questions

1. **Are we actually faster?** The perception gap applies to us too. We need controlled measurement, not subjective assessment.
2. **Context rot curve** — at what token count does recall reliability actually drop for our workloads? No rigorous benchmark exists.
3. **Compaction bug status** — is #23620 fixed in current versions? Directly affects our Agent Teams adoption.
4. **Long-term skill atrophy** — does heavy AI delegation degrade the PM's ability to evaluate output? Multiple sources raise this. Insufficient evidence to act on, worth monitoring.
5. **Plugin security posture** — 9,000+ plugins with no signing. Our local-only approach limits exposure, but MCP servers run arbitrary code.

## Methodology Note

The novelty assessment (2026-03-20) used the serial Pipeline B: Haiku scouts → coordinator cross-pollination → Sonnet deep-reads → Opus synthesis. 55+ sources in the main run, 87 in the warm RAM study.

The ecosystem survey (2026-03-21) was the first run of the **Agent Teams Pipeline B variant**: 5 Sonnet specialists collaborating via real-time messaging + 1 Opus synthesizer, all as teammates. Specialists discovered sources, deep-read them, and cross-pollinated findings with each other autonomously. ~15 minutes wall clock. The cross-cutting themes (productivity paradox surfacing across 3 topics independently, security concerns feeding from E into C and D) emerged from genuine inter-specialist dialogue, not batch coordinator processing.
