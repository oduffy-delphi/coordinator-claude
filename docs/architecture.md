# System Architecture

This document explains how coordinator-claude works: the PM-EM model, agent roles, pipeline flow, and extension points.

## The PM-EM Model

coordinator-claude implements a **PM-EM (Product Manager / Engineering Manager) dynamic** in your Claude sessions:

- **You are the PM.** You set direction, make product decisions, approve designs, and give the go/no-go on merges.
- **Claude is the EM.** Claude orchestrates work, delegates to specialists, manages pipeline flow, and verifies output. The EM doesn't write code directly — they ensure the right work gets done correctly.

This isn't just metaphor. The coordinator agent is explicitly instructed to delegate implementation to executor agents, route reviews to named reviewers, and reserve their context window for decisions rather than typing. An EM who opens a file and starts editing code has left the bridge unmanned.

### Why This Model?

Traditional Claude Code usage has one agent doing everything: writing code, reviewing it, planning work, executing plans. This creates predictable quality problems:
- The same agent reviewing its own work misses its own blind spots
- Long sessions accumulate context that degrades output quality
- No separation between "follow spec faithfully" and "challenge whether the spec is right"
- No persistent workflow knowledge — best practices must be re-established each session

The PM-EM model addresses all four.

## Three-Tier Delegation

The system uses three model tiers, each matched to the cognitive demands of their role:

| Tier | Model | Roles | Why |
|------|-------|-------|-----|
| Opus | Orchestrator | Coordinator (EM), reviewers (Patrik, Sid, Camelia, etc.), research orchestrators | Judgment, analysis, architectural decisions |
| Sonnet | Executor | Executor agents, enricher agents, review-integrator, research synthesizers | Faithful spec-following, implementation, research |
| Haiku | Verifier | Mechanical checks, template validation, compile verification, discovery scouts | Speed, cost, high-throughput mechanical work |

### The Dispatch Rule

Match the model to the cognitive demands, not the importance of the task. A trivial but architecturally significant decision goes to Opus. A complex but mechanical implementation goes to Sonnet.

## Agent Roles

### Coordinator (EM)
The main session agent. Lives in your terminal. Makes delegation decisions, verifies output, manages pipeline transitions. Does NOT write implementation code in project repos.

### Executor
Fresh Sonnet subagent dispatched per task. Receives a fully-specified stub, implements it faithfully, runs validation, reports back. The "typist, not the architect." Stops and escalates if the spec is ambiguous.

### Enricher
Research subagent. Surveys codebases, traces dependencies, fills concrete details into plan stubs (file paths, function signatures, integration points) so executors can implement without additional research.

### Review-Integrator
Applies reviewer findings to artifacts after review dispatch. Receives structured findings, applies every finding with annotations, escalates disagreements rather than silently skipping them.

### Reviewers (Opus)

| Reviewer | Domain | Personality |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Patrik** | Code quality, architecture, security | Senior engineer with exacting standards. Reviews for correctness, documentation completeness, architectural soundness. "The bar should be higher because AI can handle the overhead." |
| **Zolí** | Ambition backstop | Challenges conservative recommendations. "Given AI execution capacity, should we be more ambitious?" Only invoked as a backstop to Patrik. |
| **Sid** | Game dev, Unreal Engine | Game systems architect. Works WITH the engine, not against it. Researches documentation rather than guessing. |
| **Palí** | Front-end | Design system adherence, token validation, component patterns. "Close enough" to design specs is often correct when it means using standard utilities. |
| **Fru** | UX flow | Trust signals, clarity, intuitive flow. Reviews user-facing features for whether they make sense to a human. |
| **Camelia** | Data science, ML/AI | Statistical analysis, model architecture, feature engineering. Complements Patrik's engineering lens with quantitative expertise. |

### Research Orchestrators (Opus)
Dispatch Haiku scouts and Sonnet verifiers, evaluate quality gates, synthesize final output. Three pipeline modes:
- **Pipeline A (Codebase):** Haiku scouts survey the repo, Sonnet analysts synthesize, Opus judges
- **Pipeline B (Internet):** Multi-source web research with cross-verification and source grading
- **Pipeline C (Structured Batch):** Schema-driven research across N entities with repeating structure

## The Full Pipeline

A feature typically flows through:

```
Brainstorm -> Plan -> Enrich -> Review Enrichment -> Execute -> Spec Check -> Code Review -> Backstop -> Ship
  (skill)   (skill) (enricher)    (reviewer)       (executor) (coordinator) (Patrik+domain) (Zoli)    (skill)
```

Each stage is a quality checkpoint:
- **Brainstorm** catches wrong direction
- **Plan** catches wrong decomposition
- **Enrich** catches wrong assumptions (file doesn't exist, API changed)
- **Execute** catches wrong implementation
- **Spec check** catches spec drift (executor built something different)
- **Code review** catches quality issues
- **Backstop** catches unnecessary conservatism

Not every change needs the full pipeline. Lighter paths:
- Direct execution for small, well-understood changes
- Review-only for auditing existing code
- Single-session plan execution (no enrichment needed)

## Review Routing

The routing system is **composable**:

1. Coordinator defines universal reviewers (Patrik, Zolí) in `plugins/coordinator/routing.md`
2. Domain plugins contribute fragments via their own `routing.md` (e.g., game-dev registers Sid)
3. `/review-dispatch` merges all fragments at dispatch time
4. Changed code signals determine which reviewer handles it
5. Unmatched signals fall back to Patrik

Sequential review protocol (for non-trivial changes):
1. Domain specialist first (if applicable)
2. Coordinator applies findings
3. Patrik catches regressions (generalist pass)
4. Zolí challenges conservatism (backstop, when warranted)

### Backstop Reconciliation

When Zolí (backstop) returns:
- `BACKSTOP_AGREES` — Patrik's conservative approach is genuinely appropriate; proceed
- `BACKSTOP_CHALLENGES` — Both perspectives surface to coordinator/PM for resolution
- `BACKSTOP_OVERRIDES` — The conservative approach is clearly wrong; rare "iceberg" territory

## Session Lifecycle

### Session Start
The SessionStart hook fires and injects:
1. Orientation documents (repo map, DIRECTORY.md if present)
2. EM discipline reminder (context-aware: full model for this repo, light-touch for project repos)

Then `/session-start` command runs the full orientation protocol.

### Session Continuity
State survives compaction through:
- **Tasks API** (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList/TaskGet) — per-conversation flight recorder, persists through compaction by design
- **Handoffs** — structured disk-based state capture between sessions
- **Orientation cache** — compact project awareness document, sub-second load
- **Plan documents** — on-disk specs with write-ahead status fields

### Session End
`/session-end` captures lessons, updates docs, commits. `/handoff` creates a structured state dump for the next session.

## Plugin Extension Model

The plugin system is designed for extension. Each plugin contributes:
- `agents/` — agent definitions with YAML frontmatter
- `routing.md` — routing fragment (optional, for domain-specific reviewers)
- `skills/` — skill definitions (optional, coordinator plugin only)
- `commands/` — slash commands (optional, coordinator plugin only)
- `hooks/` — hook scripts (optional)
- `CLAUDE.md` — project-context instructions injected automatically

To add a new domain (e.g., mobile-dev, security, devops):
1. Create `plugins/my-domain/`
2. Add `agents/my-reviewer.md` with YAML frontmatter
3. Add `routing.md` with the routing fragment
4. Enable in `settings.json`

The coordinator does not need to change. See [docs/customization.md](customization.md) for details.

## The Write-Ahead Status Protocol

Every pipeline phase follows a write-ahead pattern: mark the document *before* starting work, update *after* completing. This prevents ambiguous state after crashes.

Status values flow through a defined state machine:

```
Pending enrichment
  -> Enrichment in progress
    -> Enriched -- pending review
      -> Under review by [Name]
        -> Enriched and reviewed
          -> Execution in progress
            -> Execution complete -- pending verification
              -> Done
```

Two-layer breadcrumbs:
1. **Tracker** — coordinator marks status before dispatch, commits it
2. **Stub document** — agent marks its own status as first action

With both layers, crash state is unambiguous. See `plugins/coordinator/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full state machine.
