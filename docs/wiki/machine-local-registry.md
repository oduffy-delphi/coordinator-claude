# Machine-local Registry

<!-- spec-backlink: archive/specs/2026-05/2026-05-19-machine-local-registry.md § 5 -->

This wiki is the **substrate doctrine** — what belongs in the registry, how the reader resolves values, what does NOT belong. For **operator-facing health verification** of the registry (is my install populated correctly? what to do when probes fail?), see the companion wiki: [`coordinator-doctor.md`](coordinator-doctor.md). Together these wikis form the doctrine-vs-operator-guide pair for the machine-local substrate.

**Purpose.** Durable doctrine for the per-machine registry at `<settings-home>/machine-local` (canonical location, resolved as `${COORDINATOR_SETTINGS_HOME:-${CLAUDE_HOME:-$HOME}/.coordinator-claude-settings}/machine-local` on a POSIX host, or via rung 0 / Shape W in `coordinator/snippets/resolve-coordinator-bin.md` on a PowerShell host — see §4e for the full ladder; `~/.claude/machine-local` is a transitional compat symlink during the phase-2 gated migration window, not the canonical root). Covers what belongs there, what does not, how the reader resolves values, anti-patterns, and how this substrate composes with the rest of the coordinator install chain.

## 1. Purpose and Disambiguation

The machine-local registry is **operator-set, machine-specific configuration** — the system administrator's `~/.gitconfig` is the right mental model. The operator sets values once per machine; tooling reads them deterministically. It is not:

- A **Claude Code plugin** (`~/.claude/plugins/` is the plugin directory; the registry lives at `<settings-home>/machine-local` — see §4e — deliberately outside that namespace).
- A **project-rag addon** — the host/addon split governs corpus content and MCP tooling. The registry is orthogonal to that architecture.
- An **MCP server** — nothing in the registry changes at runtime; it is not queried via a running server process. Runtime-queryable state belongs in MCP introspection (see §2).

The scope is: stable per-machine paths and environment roots that any tool, language, or repo needs to find — sibling-repo roots, vendor SDK roots (Unreal install, CUDA toolkit), and other per-machine invariants. The empirical origin is four independent EM teams each inventing the same primitive for inter-repo discovery, none aware of the others; §1 of the design plan documents all four cases.

**What this replaces — the four independent reinventions (plan §1.2):**

| Prior approach | Location | Why it fell short |
|---|---|---|
| `setup/publish-targets.sh` | coordinator meta-repo | Shell-only, single-purpose; unknown to any other tool |
| `~/.project-rag/wiring.env` | project-rag | Shell-sourceable env assignments; `.env` format breaks non-shell consumers; per-project namespace doesn't scale |
| Proposed `addon-resolvers/<addon>.py` | example-game-repo (proposal) | Wrong scope dimension (per-addon, not per-machine); dual-identity hazard |
| Distributed env-var sprawl | example-game-repo | ~9 cross-machine env vars + 5 orthogonal doctor precedence chains |

The registry is the single audited place all of these needed to be. The anti-pattern each represents is still alive; if you see a new `~/.<tool>/config.toml` or a per-repo `TOOL_ROOT=` env var being invented, that is the reinvention detector firing.

## 2. When to Put a Value in Machine-local vs. Discover at Runtime

The discriminator is **stability and source of truth**:

| Value type | Belongs in | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Stable per-machine path (sibling repo root, vendor SDK install dir) | `machine-local/registry.local.toml` | Set once by the operator; no live source; persistence is correct. Machine-specific paths go in `.local.toml`, never tracked `registry.toml` — see §8(f)/§9 |
| Runtime state (which corpus is currently bound, daemon PID, active consumer-project path) | Live MCP introspection | Changes with each invocation; a stale file would be a receipt, not an answer |
| Per-project state (project root, project type, skill overrides) | Project `.claude/` config | Varies per project, not per machine |
| Universal constant (same on every machine, not sensitive) | The relevant repo, committed | Git-tracked durability is the right primitive; no operator action needed |
| Sibling-repo path needed by a dispatcher CLI | `machine-local/registry.local.toml` | Cross-repo memo dispatcher resolves receiver paths at runtime; registry is the only cross-machine-stable source (PM-endorsed) |
| Per-invocation override (CI one-off, test harness path) | `MACHINE_LOCAL_<KEY>` env var | The intentional escape hatch — see §4 resolution order |

Per `docs/wiki/plugin-identity-and-health-sentinels.md`: live = MCP truth (current = answer); persistent = receipt (stale = signal). Machine-local values sit on the "persistent, operator-audited" side. They change when the operator reorganizes their machine, not when a tool runs. If you find yourself wanting to write to machine-local from an MCP server or a script, stop — see anti-patterns §7(b).

## 3. Relationship to `plugin-identity-and-health-sentinels.md`

The two wikis are companion doctrines. `plugin-identity-and-health-sentinels.md` defines what operator-set configuration is and why it sits outside the decay-discipline that governs plugin receipts and MCP introspection. That wiki's § Scope explicitly names machine-local registry values as operator-set configuration — stable, no live source, persistence is intentional and correct, not a decay signal.

Machine-local is where that wiki's "operator-set configuration" concept lives on disk. If you are deciding whether something belongs in machine-local or in an MCP introspection call, read `plugin-identity-and-health-sentinels.md § Scope` for the full decay-discipline framing.

## 4. Resolution Order

> **Doctrine-seed (from project-rag-em — resolution-behavior SSOT).** The durable
> cross-machine **`repos.*` sibling-repo resolution-behavior** axis — the 4-rung ladder (explicit
> flag/env → tracked OS-keyed search-roots + marker autodiscovery → tracked exceptions table →
> `registry.local.toml` fallback), the identity-marker convention, and the fail-loud seam — is
> specified by project-rag's `docs/wiki/cross-machine-path-resolution-contract.md` (SSOT for that
> axis, per /shape-ratified DoE delegation). §4c and
> §5a reflect the split. Key-namespace SCHEMA, the reader contract (§7), and the helper surface
> remain coordinator-owned.

The reader (`machine-local get <key>`) resolves in this order, most-specific-and-most-local first:

```
1. <concern>.local.toml (most specific + per-machine)
2. <concern>.toml (most specific shared)
3. registry.local.toml (per-machine)
4. registry.toml (shared baseline)
5. MACHINE_LOCAL_<KEY> env override (intentional one-off escape — NOT highest precedence; env-vars are ambient, registry is deliberate; see DR-087 for the reconciliation with §4c rung 1's REPO_<REPO_ID>, which sits ABOVE this ladder for repos.* keys specifically — the two do not contradict once the discriminant is read as value PROVENANCE, not ambience: a registry-derived export cannot diverge from the thing it would shadow, a side-channel-derived export can)
6. --default (if provided)
7. exit 1 (clean absence — operational failures exit 2; see §4.1)
```

Layers 1–4 are all `.toml` files and all outrank the env layer. The env layer (5) sits below all `.toml` layers because env-vars in a parent process are *ambient*, not deliberate — any export in a parent shell, IDE launch configuration, `.envrc`, or CI step would silently shadow the operator's registry values if env ranked above them. The registry's authority comes precisely from being the audited, operator-set source. The env var is an emergency one-off escape valve, not the default channel.

**DR-087 — `docs/decisions/DR-087-repo-repo-id-env-override-family-ratified.md`** ratifies `REPO_<REPO_ID>` (§4c rung 1) as the fleet's canonical env-override family for `repos.*` sibling-discovery. **Its discriminant is value PROVENANCE, not ambience.** An ambient export is not itself a violation: `claude-machine-local.sh` (Ergonomic helpers, below) ambiently exports `$REPO_<NAME>` on every source, and that is the sanctioned surface — the value IS the registry's own live answer, so it cannot diverge from what this rung distrusts shadowing, and §4b's `[[ -z ]]` guard still lets an operator-pre-set value win. The violation is narrower: exporting a `REPO_<REPO_ID>`-shaped variable sourced from a channel that CAN diverge from the registry — a pointer file, a baked path, anything a decision record has demoted — promotes a demoted value to rung-1 authority and defeats the escape hatch exactly when someone reaches for it. Historical named case (see DR-087's addendum): `claude-doe-shim.sh.tmpl` injecting the DR-071-demoted `.doe-root` mirror. `MACHINE_LOCAL_<KEY>` (this rung) and `REPO_<REPO_ID>` do not conflict — both trust only registry-equivalent or operator-typed values; they differ in scope (any key vs. `repos.*`) and ranking (below vs. above the TOML layers).

**`MACHINE_LOCAL_<KEY>` naming.** The key `repos.example_game_workbench_repo` maps to env var `MACHINE_LOCAL_REPOS_EXAMPLE_GAME_WORKBENCH_REPO` (dots and hyphens become underscores, all uppercase). It supersedes ad-hoc per-repo env-var opt-ins (e.g. `EXAMPLE_GAME_REPO_ROOT=`, `docs/wiki/cross-repo-citation-conventions.md § peerless-installs`): one named registry, one documented fallback chain.

**Short shell-out examples:**

```bash
# Resolve a sibling-repo root; fail loud if not set
repo=$(machine-local get repos.example_game_workbench_repo)

# Resolve with a sibling-relative fallback (belt-and-suspenders pattern)
repo=$(machine-local get repos.example_game_workbench_repo --default "$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/../example-game-workbench-repo" && pwd)")
```

Consumers that want the full resolution chain (registry → sibling-relative → error with remediation) compose it themselves using `--default` or by checking the exit code of `machine-local has <key>` before the fallback.

**Do not guess a `repos.<key>` from a repo's hyphenated name.** Registry keys are mostly, but not uniformly, underscore-normalized — `claude_klabauter`, `doe_claude`, and `example_game_workbench_repo` underscore-normalize the repo name, but `repos.example-game-repo-python-audit` and `repos.zzztest-normcheck` keep literal hyphens. A wrong-separator guess (e.g. `repos.claude-klabauter` for a key stored as `repos.claude_klabauter`) is not silent: `machine-local get` emits a stderr-only "did you mean '<real key>'?" hint on the miss (separator-insensitive, so it catches this exact class of guess), and if the guess collides on both separator forms, lists all matches. Guessing the namespace itself (`repos`) instead of a leaf key gets a "namespace, not a key" pointer at `machine-local keys --prefix repos`. Run `machine-local keys --prefix repos` (or `machine-local keys | grep '^repos\.'`) to enumerate every registered key directly, rather than substituting on a guess.

### 4.1 Read-path exit-code contract — absence is not failure

A consumer that swallows any non-zero (`val=$(machine-local get X 2>/dev/null) || val=$fallback`) must be able to tell a **cleanly-absent key** from a reader that **could not produce an answer at all** — otherwise an operational failure silently masquerades as absence and the fallback fires when it should have fail-loud. The `get`/`has` read path therefore uses three exit codes:

| rc | meaning | when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | success | value found (`get`) / key present (`has`) |
| `1` | clean absence | `get`: key not found; `has`: key not set — the normal fall-back signal |
| `2` | operational failure | reader could not answer: Python < 3.11 version guard, malformed TOML |

A consumer that genuinely wants "use fallback on absence but fail-loud on a broken reader" branches on `2`:

```bash
val=$(machine-local get repos.foo); rc=$?
case $rc in
  0) : ;;                                  # got it
  1) val=$fallback ;;                       # cleanly absent — fall back
  *) echo "machine-local reader failed (rc=$rc)" >&2; exit "$rc" ;;  # operational — fail loud
esac
```

Without this contract, a reader that cannot answer (e.g. an MCP daemon launched under a stripped `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` running the wrapper against a guard-failing system Python) exits `1`, indistinguishable from "key absent" — the daemon then degrades to `None` instead of failing loud. The write commands `set` / `array-*` have no "absent" concept and keep the simpler `0` = success / non-zero = refused-or-failed convention. `unset` (§5b.1) is the exception — an already-absent key is a legitimate no-op — so it adopts this section's 0/1/2 contract.

**Wrapper interpreter resolution.** The `machine-local` shell wrapper does **not** blindly take the first `python3` on `PATH` — under a stripped PATH that can be a guard-failing system Python. It probes candidates (`python3.14`…`python3.11`, then the generics) and execs the first that satisfies the `>=3.11` guard, self-healing for any caller whose PATH carries a good interpreter even when it isn't first. When the only reachable interpreter is older than 3.11 (nothing the wrapper can fix), it still execs it so the impl emits its actionable guard message and the operational `2`. Defense-in-depth with the contract above; cross-repo memo `2026-06-24-daemon-machine-local-readpath-rootcause-correction.md`.

### 4.2 Reading more than one key — `dump`, not a `get` loop

**`machine-local get` is for ONE named key. For two or more, use `machine-local dump`.**

```bash
machine-local dump                      # every key, as a JSON object
machine-local dump --prefix repos       # one namespace
```

`keys`-then-`get`-per-key costs **1+N processes** for what is a single small file read — a shim, an
interpreter start, and a full layer parse per key. Measured against a 126-key registry on the
reference Windows box: **128 processes / 17.6s**, against **one process / 343ms** for `dump`. This
registry is read on every machine, by every repo, on paths as hot as session boot; the loop shape is
a defect wherever it appears, not merely a slow spot.

`dump` resolves through the same kernel `get` uses (`resolve_one`) — `repos.*` 4-rung ladder and env
layer included — so a dumped value is byte-identical to what `get` prints. Three contract points:

- **Membership means "`get` would succeed."** Cleanly-absent keys are omitted, never emitted as
  empty or null — including the tracked-baseline `repos.x = ""` sentinels that enumerate under
  `keys` but resolve not-found (§4.1).
- **A per-key operational failure does not abort the batch.** The failing key is named on stderr and
  rc is 2 (§4.1); stdout still carries every other key.
- **Enumeration is TOML-layer-only.** A key supplied *only* by a `MACHINE_LOCAL_<KEY>` env override
  resolves under `get` but does not appear in a dump. Resolve it by name.

**Python consumers skip the subprocess entirely:** import `_machine_local` (§4a bootstrap-lookup
rules) and call `resolve_one(key, layers)` over `_build_resolution_layers(_registry_dir())`.

### 4.3 The reader's own cost — budget it in processes, not milliseconds

This reader sits on hot fleet-wide surfaces, so both entrypoints resolve their interpreter without
spawning one to ask:

- **POSIX (`bin/machine-local`).** The forwarder is itself Python: when the interpreter running it
  already satisfies the impl's `>=3.11` guard, it loads the impl **in-process** — one process for the
  whole invocation. The probe ladder (up to six `python -c` spawns) serves the case it was written
  for, a stripped `PATH` whose `python3` is macOS system Python 3.9, where the forwarder itself runs
  under <3.11 and the fast path declines. An explicit `MACHINE_LOCAL_PYTHON` outranks the fast path.
- **Windows (`bin/machine-local.cmd`).** `cmd.exe` cannot host the impl, so two processes is the
  floor. Its `where python.exe` tier — 306–555ms per call — resolves once into a one-line sidecar,
  `<settings-home>/bin/.python-bin`, shared with the POSIX forwarder so either entrypoint warms the
  other. A cached path that fails its existence check is replaced by a fresh probe, so a moved or
  uninstalled Python self-heals.

Neither cache is re-version-checked on read — that would reintroduce the spawn it exists to remove.
An interpreter downgraded below 3.11 in place lands on `_machine_local.py`'s own version guard (rc=2,
actionable), where the last-resort fallback already lands.

**`__PYTHON_BIN__` stays tier 1** and is worth baking at install time; the cache is what makes an
unbaked install cost one slow call rather than one per call.

## 4a. `CLAUDE_HOME` — canonical escape hatch for `~/.claude` path resolution

The machine-local registry resolves *values* with a documented precedence chain (§4). The companion question — *where does `~/.claude` itself live?* — has the same shape and is formalized here as cross-repo doctrine so peer plans (project-rag F11, example-game-repo, deep-research, future Python/TS/Rust consumers) adopt one convention instead of inventing N variants.

> **Fleet ruling (ratified).** This §4a convention — `CLAUDE_HOME` is a `$HOME` substitute, not a `.claude/` substitute — is THE fleet convention; there is no competing form. Every consumer resolving `~/.claude` / `~/.claude.json` aligns to it (example-game-repo's `resolve_claude_home.sh` treating `CLAUDE_HOME` as the `.claude` dir is the divergent side and aligns to §4a). See `cross-repo/inbox/2026-07-21-example-game-repo-em-dr072-claude-home-convention-ruling-and-doe-self-deviations.md` for the ruling; canon and code agree at `coordinator/bin/host-gpu-probe.py`'s own `CLAUDE_HOME` resolution. `.claude.json` sits directly under the `CLAUDE_HOME` root per the filesystem layout below.

**Filesystem layout — `.claude.json` and `.claude/` are siblings under `$HOME`, not nested.** Reads matter here:

```
$HOME/
  .claude.json        <-- Claude Code's config (a single JSON file)
  .claude/            <-- Claude Central directory (this wiki's subject)
    machine-local/
    plugins/
    bin/
```

`CLAUDE_HOME` is a **`$HOME` substitute**, not a `.claude/` substitute. Setting `CLAUDE_HOME=/tmp/sandbox` redirects `.claude.json` to `/tmp/sandbox/.claude.json` and the entire `.claude/` install to `/tmp/sandbox/.claude/`. This matches `plugins/project-rag/scripts/_claude_config.py`'s long-standing semantics; the coordinator-side resolver was authored to be coherent with it.

**Resolution order for the `$HOME` analog.** Any tool that reads or writes `~/.claude.json` or anything inside `~/.claude/` MUST resolve the base directory in this order, most-specific first:

```
1. CLAUDE_HOME   — $HOME substitute (test sandboxes, CI runners, alt installs)
2. HOME          — POSIX-canonical (Linux/macOS/git-bash/MSYS/WSL)
3. USERPROFILE   — Windows-canonical fallback (native cmd.exe / PowerShell without HOME)
4. Path.home()   — language-stdlib last resort (Python `pathlib.Path.home()`, Node `os.homedir()`, etc.)
5. exit 1        — refuse to guess; emit remediation pointing here
```

From the resolved `$HOME` analog, the downstream paths derive trivially: `<home>/.claude.json`, `<home>/.claude/`, `<home>/.claude/plugins/`. The machine-local registry itself is the one exception — it does NOT hang off this `$HOME` analog; it resolves via the independent settings-home ladder (§4e), whose canonical target is `<settings-home>/machine-local` (`~/.claude/machine-local` is only a transitional compat symlink to it).

**Why `CLAUDE_HOME` ranks above `HOME`.** Unlike `MACHINE_LOCAL_<KEY>` env vars (which rank *below* the registry because the registry is the deliberate audited source — §4), `CLAUDE_HOME` ranks *above* `HOME` because it answers a different question: not "what is this value" but "where does the entire Claude install live for this invocation". Test sandboxes, CI runners, scratch installs, and per-user-on-shared-machine setups all need to point the resolution at an alternate root without polluting the operator's real `$HOME`. There is no "registry of registries" to consult above it; `CLAUDE_HOME` *is* the deliberate audited override at this layer.

**Canonical resolver — `claude-home`.** Installed by `/coordinator:install` Phase 3 Step 3 alongside `machine-local`. Same shape: shell shim → Python module → Windows `.cmd`. Source-of-truth at claude-klabauter's `coordinator/lib/claude-home/` (migrated from DoE-claude, commit b644d5a9 — load-bearing module: README + tests + artifacts co-located); install destination `<settings-home>/bin/` (§4e), the only place it is minted — no forwarder exists at `~/.claude/bin/`. The `lib/<module>/` location is deliberate — it signals "cross-repo contract surface, do not customize" rather than "template scaffolding the operator may modify." Use from any coordinator-installed environment:

```bash
# Resolve the $HOME analog (CLAUDE_HOME if set, else $HOME)
home=$(claude-home home)

# Resolve the ~/.claude.json path
config_path=$(claude-home path)

# Resolve the ~/.claude directory itself
claude_dir=$(claude-home dir)

# Resolve sub-locations directly (avoids dirname/basename gymnastics)
ml_dir=$(claude-home machine-local)   # DELEGATES to 'machine-local dir' (settings-home seam) — see §4e
plugins_dir=$(claude-home plugins)
```

**`claude-home machine-local` delegation note.** `claude-home machine-local` is a **working delegation alias** — it exec-forwards to the `machine-local dir` subcommand (settings-home seam, §4e) rather than returning `<claude-dir>/machine-local` directly. This keeps existing `claude-home machine-local` callers working through the compat window. Removal is gated on the 5 consumer confirmations, same as the phase-2 compat tail. `claude-home dir` continues to return the genuine `~/.claude` directory.

Python callers can import the module instead of shelling out (it sits at `<settings-home>/bin/_claude_home.py` after install — §4e; nothing is minted at `~/.claude/bin/_claude_home.py`):

```python
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Resolve the bin/ location using the same precedence as the module itself.
# CLAUDE_HOME wins over HOME; do NOT use Path.home() unconditionally because it
# ignores CLAUDE_HOME and risks importing the wrong copy under test sandboxes.
_base = Path(os.environ.get("CLAUDE_HOME") or os.environ.get("HOME") or Path.home())
sys.path.insert(0, str(_base / ".claude" / "bin"))

from _claude_home import (
    claude_home_dir, claude_config_path, machine_local_dir,
    read_config, write_config,
)
```

The shell-out form is preferred for cross-language portability AND avoids the dual-identity hazard (§8(a)) — if anything else also imports `_claude_home` via a different `sys.path` insertion, two module copies live in `sys.modules` with separate state. The import form is fine for Python-only callers that want to avoid subprocess startup cost (~50ms cold-start on Windows) AND are confident they are the only importer in their process.

**Generic JSON I/O surface.** `_claude_home.py` ships the two generic primitives any install script touching `~/.claude.json` needs: `read_config()` (BOM-tolerant, returns `{}` for absent files, enriches `JSONDecodeError` with the file path) and `write_config()` (atomic tempfile + `os.replace`, creates parent dir, cleans up tmp files on failure). Higher-level shape-specific helpers — e.g., "update a single `mcpServers` entry under global vs `projects.<root>.mcpServers`" — stay with their consumer; those carry policy decisions (key-collision rules, project-key normalization) that don't generalize.

**Cross-repo alignment — coordinator is canonical.** `claude-home` (path resolver) plus the JSON I/O primitives ship with `/coordinator:install`. Peer repos that inline a CLAUDE_HOME precedence chain (notably `plugins/project-rag/scripts/_claude_config.py`) should consume this surface and retire their local copies; the only thing that stays peer-side is the *shape-specific* layer (e.g., project-rag's `update_mcp_entry()`). Test coverage lives at claude-klabauter's `coordinator/lib/claude-home/tests/test_claude_home.py` plus `coordinator/tests/test_claude_home_contract.py` (stdlib-only `unittest`, no pytest dep).

**What this unblocks.** §4a is formalized, `claude-home` is installed by coordinator setup, and the JSON I/O primitives ship alongside it — the pattern is coordinator doctrine with a first-class resolver. Peer repos adopt by shelling out to `claude-home {home|path|dir|machine-local|plugins}` or importing the Python helpers — no precedence chain re-derivation, no duplicate test surface to maintain.

**Out of scope.** `CLAUDE_HOME` resolves *where the directory lives*, not *what is inside it*. Values inside (sibling-repo roots, vendor SDK paths, etc.) continue to resolve through the machine-local registry chain (§4). The two chains are orthogonal and compose cleanly: `CLAUDE_HOME` feeds into the settings-home ladder (§4e) that selects which `<settings-home>/machine-local/registry.toml` the reader opens; the reader's own precedence chain then resolves keys within it.

**Bootstrap-lookup vs. contents-resolution — DO NOT conflate.** A peer repo importing the central `_claude_home.py` module hits two distinct $HOME-resolution surfaces with opposite precedence rules. The mistake is using `CLAUDE_HOME` for both; the failure mode is silent test-sandbox bypass of the central path.

| Surface | What it answers | Precedence |
|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap lookup** | Where does `_claude_home.py` LIVE on disk? | `HOME` → `USERPROFILE` → `Path.home()`. **NOT `CLAUDE_HOME`.** |
| **Contents resolution** | What paths does the module's API return (`~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/`, etc.)? | Full chain: `CLAUDE_HOME` → `HOME` → `USERPROFILE` → `Path.home()`. |

Why: `/coordinator:install` installs `_claude_home.py` at the operator's REAL `$HOME/.claude/bin/`, never at `CLAUDE_HOME/.claude/bin/`. A test setting `CLAUDE_HOME=/tmp/sandbox` to redirect contents resolution will find no module at `/tmp/sandbox/.claude/bin/`, the import fails, the peer falls back to its inlined copy, and the central path is never exercised under CI. The bug is invisible until production drift between the two copies surfaces.

Reference adoption shape: claude-klabauter's `coordinator/lib/claude-home/README.md § "Adopting from a peer repo"` (migrated from DoE-claude, commit b644d5a9) carries the canonical Python snippet for the bootstrap-lookup half. Peer repos retiring inlined `_claude_config.py`-shaped modules MUST use the real-`$HOME`-only chain for the bootstrap import and let the central module own the full-precedence chain for everything it returns.

## 4b. Env-var resolver idempotency — gate re-resolution on `[[ -z ]]`

**Env-var resolvers that derive a canonical path and export it MUST gate re-resolution on `[[ -z "${VAR:-}" ]]` to prevent double-resolution in child processes.**

When a resolver script runs (e.g. the settings-home `claude-machine-local.sh` shell resolver — §4e, the only place it is minted), it exports variables such as `$REPO_PROJECT_RAG` into the shell environment. A child process that sources the same script — or a grandchild that sources it again through a nested hook — will re-run the resolver against the same registry, potentially overwriting a `MACHINE_LOCAL_<KEY>` env override that a parent process deliberately set, or recomputing a path that was already correctly set. The guard pattern:

```bash
[[ -z "${REPO_PROJECT_RAG:-}" ]] && REPO_PROJECT_RAG=$(machine-local get repos.project_rag)
export REPO_PROJECT_RAG
```

applies to every exported variable the resolver emits. The `:-` default ensures an already-set empty string is treated as unset (intentional override to blank is a separate edge case). *Source: central-improvement-queue #76.*

## 4c. `repos.*` sibling-discovery ladder — SSOT pointer

<!-- spec-backlink: project-rag/docs/wiki/cross-machine-path-resolution-contract.md (SSOT) -->

The generic key-resolution order above (§4, rungs 1–7) governs ALL keys in the registry. For the specific question of *how a `repos.<slug>` value is discovered across machines*, a four-rung behavior ladder governs the resolution and is owned by project-rag as SSOT:

**SSOT:** `project-rag/docs/wiki/cross-machine-path-resolution-contract.md`

**Naming ratification (DR-087):** `REPO_<SLUG>` (equivalently `REPO_<REPO_ID>`, keyed to the `repos.<id>` registry keys) is the fleet's ratified env-override family — see `docs/decisions/DR-087-repo-repo-id-env-override-family-ratified.md`. Its rung-1 primacy holds for both a genuinely operator-typed value and a value ambiently exported from the registry itself (e.g. `claude-machine-local.sh`'s `$REPO_<NAME>` exports — the Ergonomic-helpers section); §4 states the provenance-not-ambience discriminant and the historical named case (`claude-doe-shim.sh.tmpl`; see DR-087's addendum). Legacy `*_ROOT`-shaped names (`DOE_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_KLABAUTER_ROOT`) remain readable indefinitely by their respective resolvers per DR-087 but are not part of this ratified family and are retired from documentation going forward.

The four rungs in summary: **(1)** an explicit, operator-typed `REPO_<SLUG>` env-var or CLI flag overrides everything (see the ratification note above — the discriminant is value provenance, not ambience: a registry-derived ambient export qualifies too, and only a non-registry-derived export sourced from a divergence-capable channel does not); **(2)** a tracked `search-roots.toml` lists OS-keyed parent directories and the scanner autodiscovers repos via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` identity markers — this is the primary rung for convention-installed repos (derive-not-store, no absolute paths stored); **(3)** a small tracked `path-exceptions.toml` maps OS-keyed slug → parent-path overrides for genuinely off-convention repos that cannot appear under any standard search-root; **(4)** `registry.local.toml`'s `repos.<slug>` key is the last-resort fallback for off-convention repos not discoverable under any search-root or path-exception (rung 2/3) — the documented, supported escape hatch named in the contract's remediation string. Do NOT re-specify the rung mechanics here — the SSOT contract is the authoritative source; a second copy would drift.

Coordinator retains ownership of: the key-namespace SCHEMA (what `repos.*` keys exist and mean), the generic key-resolution order (§4), the reader contract (§7), write-authority (§5a/§5b), and the helper surface (`machine-local` CLI, tri-language wrappers). The resolution-*behavior* axis (rung order, marker convention, fail-loud seam, `search-roots.toml` format) is project-rag-contract-governed.

## 4e. Settings Home — `~/.coordinator-claude-settings` and the Registry-Dir Seam

<!-- spec-backlink: docs/plans/2026-07-06-durable-substrate-to-settings-home.md § Design -->

> **DR-072 — durable machine-local state does not belong in `~/.claude`.** This settings-home
> seam is the mechanism `docs/decisions/DR-072-durable-machine-local-coordinator-state-lives-in-settings-home-not-claude.md`
> (and its predecessor `docs/decisions/DR-071-durable-coordinator-root-anchor-settings-home-registry-doe-root-demoted-to-cache.md`)
> ratifies: durable, per-machine coordinator state lives in settings-home, not the
> resettable/synced `~/.claude` tree. See also `coordinator-settings-home` and
> `docs/wiki/state-placement-law.md § Surfaces That Deliberately Stay in ~/.claude`.

The machine-local registry and coordinator durable substrate (`bin/` resolver family, `.coordinator-venv/`, `settings-manifest.md`) live in a **settings home** that is a deliberate sibling to `~/.claude` — clone-independent and immune to user edits of the `coordinator-claude` plugin clone. (`setup/` stays at `~/.claude/setup/` — intentionally NOT migrated by the one-time settings-home migration.) Full registry-dir precedence ladder (most-specific wins):

```
MACHINE_LOCAL_REGISTRY_DIR             (rung-1: direct registry-dir override; bypasses home
                                         resolution entirely — test isolation / explicit dir path;
                                         ~16 test files + 4 production readers depend on this)
  else COORDINATOR_SETTINGS_HOME/machine-local
                                        (rung-2: home root override; sandboxes/CI/XDG users)
  else ${CLAUDE_HOME:-$HOME}/.coordinator-claude-settings/machine-local
```

**Settings home itself** (used for any sub-path other than the registry dir):

```
COORDINATOR_SETTINGS_HOME              (explicit home root override — document prominently)
  else ${CLAUDE_HOME:-$HOME}/.coordinator-claude-settings
```

**`COORDINATOR_SETTINGS_HOME` is the sanctioned escape hatch** for operators who want XDG (`~/.config/...`) or other placement. `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is intentionally NOT auto-honored — auto-XDG would break `CLAUDE_HOME`-based sandbox isolation and decouple the settings home from the sibling-to-`~/.claude` semantics.

**Linux/XDG users:** set `COORDINATOR_SETTINGS_HOME=~/.config/coordinator-claude` if you prefer XDG placement. Sandboxes and CI runners set `COORDINATOR_SETTINGS_HOME` to redirect the entire settings home to a temp dir (same mechanism as `CLAUDE_HOME` for `~/.claude`).

**`MACHINE_LOCAL_REGISTRY_DIR` is rung-1** — it bypasses home resolution entirely and targets the registry directory directly. It is NOT part of the key-resolution order (§4, rungs 1–7); it is a separate, earlier-resolving override at the *dir-location* level. This distinction matters for test isolation: ~16 test files and 4 production readers (`list-reverse-drift-cmds.py`, `check-plugin-drift.py`, claude-klabauter `coordinator/lib/detect-hardware.sh`, claude-klabauter `coordinator/bin/refresh-plugin-live-install.py`) set `MACHINE_LOCAL_REGISTRY_DIR` to a sandbox path to run against a test registry without touching the operator's real registry.

**Fail-loud on divergent-realpath-both-homes:** if both `~/.claude/machine-local` AND `<settings-home>/machine-local` exist and their `realpath` values differ, the seam fails loud with a remediation pointing at the (now-completed) one-time settings-home migration. A compat symlink at `~/.claude/machine-local` whose `realpath` equals `<settings-home>/machine-local` is NOT a second divergent home and does NOT trigger fail-loud.

**Seam is location-only.** `coordinator-settings-home` (shell) and `settings_home()` (Python, `_settings_home.py`) return the home path and stop — they do not read registry contents.

**`~/.claude` compat window (transitional, phase-2 gated).** During the transition from `~/.claude`-resident substrate, `~/.claude/machine-local` is a realpath-symlink to `<settings-home>/machine-local`. Consumers that read the old absolute path continue to resolve the relocated content unchanged. The symlink is removed only at the single phase-2 gated tail, once all 5 consumers confirm migration. See `docs/plans/2026-07-06-durable-substrate-to-settings-home.md § Transitional compat window`.

**`machine-local dir` subcommand.** Returns `<settings-home>/machine-local` as an absolute path — the sanctioned dir-resolution primitive for concern-file readers that need to construct a path to a specific concern file (e.g. `project_rag.local.toml`):

```bash
# Resolve the machine-local directory itself (not the registry.toml file — use 'path' for that):
ml_dir=$(machine-local dir)

# Construct a concern-file path without hardcoding ~/.claude/machine-local:
project_rag_toml=$(machine-local dir)/project_rag.local.toml
```

`machine-local path` continues to return the absolute path to `registry.toml` (the file, not the directory). `machine-local dir` is the NEW subcommand for directory-path resolution; it is the concrete primitive consumers need to migrate hardcoded `~/.claude/machine-local/…` dir reads.

**`<settings-home>/bin/<name>` composition is a stable consumer contract.** The `bin/` resolver family (`machine-local`, `_machine_local.py`, `claude-home`, `_claude_home.py`, and siblings) lives at `<settings-home>/bin/`. A consumer that needs the **absolute path to an impl** — rather than invoking the bare-name wrapper — may compose `<settings-home>/bin/<name>` by resolving `<settings-home>` via the ladder above and joining `bin/<name>`. This is a blessed surface: the `bin/` layout is stable across the compat window and after the phase-2 gated tail.

**Windows: resolve by path arithmetic, never by invoking the wrapper.** On Windows the bare-name `machine-local` entry is a `.cmd`/shebang wrapper that hits a `CreateProcess`-no-`PATHEXT` / shebang trap when invoked from hidden-window install children. Consumers with such sites (e.g. Example-game-repo's ~8 PS1 install sites) MUST NOT invoke the wrapper to bootstrap; instead resolve `<settings-home>` by **pure path arithmetic** in their own resolver (the ladder above — `MACHINE_LOCAL_REGISTRY_DIR` > `COORDINATOR_SETTINGS_HOME` > the `CLAUDE_HOME`-or-`HOME`-rooted `.coordinator-claude-settings` default). Once `<settings-home>` is resolved, compose its `bin/_machine_local.py` path, and invoke `python <that path> get <key>`. Arithmetic resolution executes no wrapper, so it dodges the trap entirely.

**Pin the composed path to the CLI; never read `registry.toml` to resolve it.** The arithmetic resolver is a *fallback that must not drift* from the canonical `coordinator-settings-home` CLI. Pin it with a parity/drift test comparing the arithmetic result against the CLI output, and resolve using arithmetic only — never open `registry.toml` to compute a path. This is the shape project-rag adopted for its impl-path sites. A `machine-local impl-path` wrapper subcommand would NOT solve the Windows problem — invoking it hits the same wrapper trap the `.py` pin exists to dodge; arithmetic composition of `<settings-home>/bin/<name>` is the seam.

## 4d. `.claude.json` `projects` map — EM last-resort repo-discovery hint (advisory)

The registry chains above (§4/§4c) resolve a **known** repo slug to a path. A different question — *which repos of note even exist on this machine?* — is normally answered by the curated sources (the `repos.*` namespace, `working-repos.yaml`, the sibling-repo enumeration in `the (now-removed) meta-repo local-doctrine file`). When those are absent, thin, or you are in doubt, `~/.claude.json`'s top-level `projects` map is a **fallback hint an EM/DoE may consult** — Claude Code auto-maintains it as the set of directories it has been invoked in, so it needs no coordinator upkeep.

Treat hits as **candidates to confirm, never registry entries**. The map is a lossy proxy for "repos of note" in both directions:

- **False positives (noise):** it records every cwd ever used — junk one-off folders, scratch dirs, and subdirectories deep inside a repo, none of which are projects. Confirm a hit is a repo root (`.git` present) and is significant before acting on it.
- **False negatives (gaps):** a repo worked in only via `gh` / subagents / dispatch — never as a Claude Code cwd — will not appear at all. Several sibling repos on non-primary machines are exactly this shape (see `the (now-removed) meta-repo local-doctrine file`). Absence from the map is **not** evidence a repo doesn't exist.

Because of both, `.claude.json` is a discovery *hint*, not a source of truth: it never overrides the curated registry, and it is per-machine and Anthropic-owned (undocumented, unversioned schema) — read it opportunistically, do not build tooling that depends on its shape. Resolve its path via `claude-home path` (§4a), not a hardcoded `~/.claude.json`. New repos worthy of a registry entry surface rarely enough that this stays a doctrinal pointer, not a system.

## 5. Relationship to `plugin-extraction-and-distribution.md` and `cross-repo-citation-conventions.md`

These two wikis define the **port-time cleanup contract** for the coordinator install chain: when extracting a plugin or porting vendored code, sweep absolute paths and replace them with sibling-relative references (`../<sibling-repo>/<path>`). That contract is **unchanged by this wiki** — at port time, the consumer does not yet exist to be told about machine-local. Sibling-relative is the correct vocabulary for the extraction step.

What this wiki establishes is context for the **runtime `repos.<slug>` discovery order** for consumers that already exist. That order defers to the 4-rung ladder in §4c (SSOT: `project-rag/docs/wiki/cross-machine-path-resolution-contract.md`). The blind `../<sibling-repo>/` walk is not a runtime rung — marker-autodiscovery (§4c rung 2) serves the "operator hasn't populated the registry" case instead, with no sibling-layout compliance required.

The four failure modes that motivated this change remain valid doctrine — and explain WHY the walk is not the runtime mechanism: (a) it dictates operator filesystem layout; (b) it cannot represent deterministic locations (vendor binaries on a specific drive); (c) it fails opaquely with no remediation hint; (d) it does not compose with triangular dependency graphs where moving any one vertex breaks every sibling-relative inside the moved repo.

Port-time cleanup uses sibling-relatives because that is still better than absolute paths leaking into shipped code. Runtime `repos.<slug>` discovery follows the §4c ladder. Cross-link: `docs/wiki/plugin-extraction-and-distribution.md § 11`, `docs/wiki/cross-repo-citation-conventions.md § Sibling-layout convention`.

## 5a. Schema-Authorship vs. Value-Writing — Who Owns What

A recurring failure mode (observed across multiple EM sessions) is reading "the coordinator owns the registry" as "EMs other than the coordinator team should not write here," then sidecarring `~/.<tool>/config.toml` to avoid the perceived gate. That is the opposite of the design intent. Two distinct authorities are at play; conflating them is the bug:

- **Schema authorship** (coordinator-team responsibility). The shape of shared keys (`repos.*`, `install.*`, `plugin.mirrors.*`), the generic key-resolution order (§4), the reader contract (§7), and the helper surface (`machine-local`, `claude-machine-local.sh/ps1`, the Python module) are coordinator-governed because every consumer depends on them. Changing the reader contract, renaming a shared namespace, or adding a tracked baseline key requires coordinator-team coherence. **Exception — `repos.*` sibling-resolution-BEHAVIOR:** the rung order, marker-autodiscovery convention, and fail-loud seam for `repos.<slug>` discovery across machines are governed by project-rag's contract SSOT (`project-rag/docs/wiki/cross-machine-path-resolution-contract.md`); see §4c. The coordinator's schema and helper surface implement that behavior contract — they do not set the policy.

- **Value writing** (anyone on the machine). Appending values under existing namespaces, opening a new tool-specific namespace (`mything.*`), or hand-editing per-machine paths in `registry.local.toml` does NOT require coordinator-team sign-off. The reader is schemaless by design — no per-key validation, no declaration step (§7). The registry's whole value proposition is being the convenient shared place that prevents per-tool sidecars from accreting; gatekeeping value-writes would defeat the substrate.

The library/service distinction is useful here: this is a **library**, not a **service**. The coordinator ships the schema and helpers; callers freely write values under the schema. Treating it service-shaped (writes mediated by the coordinator team) is the misread §5b exists to correct.

## 5b. Adding a Value or Namespace — The Cheap Path Is the Default

Four shapes, only one is heavyweight:

1. **Per-machine path that varies across your machines.** Append a key to `registry.local.toml`. No declaration step required. The reader is schemaless; declaring an empty placeholder in tracked `registry.toml` is *optional* and only useful if you want the key shape to be discoverable across machines via git.
2. **New namespace cluster you own** (`mything.*`, `mytool.*`). Just use it. The `concerns` array (§6) gates *concern-file isolation* (whether `mything.*` reads from a separate `mything.toml`), not *namespace existence*. A new namespace under `registry.local.toml` needs zero registration.
3. **Sanctioned auto-writer** (your installer or daemon writes values, not just reads them). Heavier — §6's machine-generated-write-authority criterion applies, with single registered writer, declared sources, loud-fail on collision, and a `[provenance]` table. Worked example: project-rag's `wire` writes `[env]`/`[provenance]` to the **untracked** `project_rag.local.toml` — those values are machine-specific corpus paths, so by §9 they belong in the `.local` layer, not the tracked baseline. The tracked `project_rag.toml` carries only the operator-stable `[addons]` registration (enabled-flags, set by setup Phase 7D — not a per-machine path). This is the only path that warrants the heavier criteria; it is heavy because *unsupervised writers* need clobber-discipline, not because *humans/EMs adding values* do. **Concern-file provenance shape:** the `[provenance]` block lives at the concern-file root (not `[provenance.<concern>]`) because the concern name is already the file's namespace; provenance uses per-key sub-tables (e.g., `[provenance.install_root]`) to support multi-writer collision diagnosis when more than one automated writer contributes keys to the same concern file.
4. **Hand-edited cross-machine value** (same on every machine — schema version, a public URL). Append to `registry.toml`. It travels via git.

If you find yourself reading the wiki to figure out whether you "may" add a value — the answer is yes, cases 1, 2, and 4 are the default and need no authorization. Case 3 is the only one with criteria, and the criteria gate *automated writer patterns*, not human authorship.

**Writing a single concern key from the CLI — `machine-local set --concern`.** The bare `machine-local set <key> <value>` writer refuses namespaced keys (a `unreal.*` write is redirected to the concern file that owns the namespace). To set one concern key without hand-editing the TOML (which loses atomicity + provenance) or invoking a concern-owner's full seeder, use:

```bash
machine-local set --concern unreal unreal.samples_root /path/to/samples
```

It resolves `<name>.local.toml`, validates the key is under the `<name>.` namespace (rejecting cross-concern writes), does an atomic read-merge-write that preserves every other key/table, writes the key under the self-named `[<name>]` table (the form the reader's self-named-table elision expects — §4), and stamps `[provenance.<bare_key>]` (`written_by = 'machine-local'`, `source = 'cli:--concern'`). If `<name>` is not yet in the `concerns` array it writes anyway but emits a note that the value will not resolve via `get` until the concern is registered (§6). This is the general-purpose CLI counterpart to a concern-owner's bespoke seeder (e.g. the addon's `_seed_unreal_keys.py --set`), which remains valid as a seeder-local shortcut. Spec: cross-repo memo `2026-06-23-machine-local-concern-set-writer.md`.

## 5b.1. Removing a value — `machine-local unset`

```bash
machine-local unset <key> [--global] [--dry-run]
```

Removes a string-scalar key from ONE file — `registry.local.toml` by default, `registry.toml` with `--global`. Use it instead of hand-commenting a line: a hand-edit loses to any peer's concurrent `set`; `unset` shares `set`'s atomic write path.

**Target-file-scoped, not resolution-stack-scoped.** After unsetting from `registry.local.toml`, `machine-local has <key>` may still exit 0 because `registry.toml`, a concern layer, or the env layer still supplies it. Correct, not a bug.

**Exit codes** — §4.1's tri-state, not `set`'s 0/non-zero. Idempotent: two consecutive calls return `0` then `1`.

| rc | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | present, removed (or would be, under `--dry-run`) |
| `1` | already absent — clean no-op, no write, no stderr noise |
| `2` | operational failure: malformed target TOML, array-valued key (use `array-set`), non-string scalar, an unhandled shape (inline table, array-of-tables), round-trip failure, write failure, or `--concern` |

**Negative-specs.** An emptied `[table]` header is left in place (a generic sweep is unsafe; an empty table resolves to nothing) — `unset` prints a note instead. `--concern` is accepted then refused at runtime, so the operator gets a reason rather than "unrecognized arguments": leaf removal would strand `_cmd_set_concern`'s `[provenance.<key>]` table, so hand-edit `<NAME>.local.toml`. Unlike `set`, there is no concern-namespace guard — removing a stale concern-namespace key from a registry file is this verb's cleanup case.

## 5c.1. `repos.*` — Sibling-Repo Discovery, Not Publish Mirrors

> **Disambiguation.** "Working" here means *not a publish mirror* (see the
> contrast with `publish.mirrors.*` in §5c.2) — `repos.*` is the set of
> sibling repos scripts/agents may need to locate on this machine. It does

The `repos.*` namespace serves **one purpose**: sibling-repo discovery for scripts and agents (§5) — i.e. it is not a publish-mirror namespace. Publish-target mirror paths live in the distinct `publish.mirrors.*` namespace (§5c.2): DEST roots for the publish tool's targets resolve via `publish-mirror:<key>` portable rows, which resolve via `machine-local get publish.mirrors.<key>.path` exclusively (see §5c.2). `repos.coordinator_claude` and `repos.deep_research_claude` do not exist — the equivalent values live at `publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude` / `publish.mirrors.deep_research_claude`.

The shared publish topology (which targets exist and what they publish) is committed to `setup/publish-targets.portable` and travels via git. Only the per-machine mirror DEST path stays in gitignored `registry.local.toml` — now under `[publish.mirrors.*]` tables. Provisioning a new machine:

```bash
machine-local set publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude.path   /abs/path/to/coordinator-claude
machine-local set publish.mirrors.deep_research_claude.path /abs/path/to/deep-research-claude
```

After that, claude-klabauter `coordinator/bin/publish.py` reads the portable topology from `setup/publish-targets.portable` and resolves all DEST roots from the registry — zero hand-authored absolute rows.

**Bootstrap precondition.** The `machine-local set` remediation shown above (and emitted by the publish tool on an unset key) presupposes the `machine-local` CLI is on PATH and `machine-local/` already exists. On a truly fresh OSS install neither may hold — the failure mode is "command not found", not a registry miss. This is exactly why a legacy pre-machine-local fallback path is deliberately retained and not retired: it gives fresh-install operators a working path before the machine-local substrate is bootstrapped.

## 5c.2. `publish.mirrors.*` — Publish-Target Mirror Destinations

The `publish.mirrors.*` namespace holds outward-only OSS distribution destinations — repos the coordinator team *pushes to* and must *never* treat as source or working trees.

### Three-namespace taxonomy
<!-- Review: code-reviewer-b1042315 — F6: kept the old heading's self-documenting cardinality now that the table has 3 rows. -->

| Class | Namespace | Purpose | How to resolve |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working repos (sibling-discovery sense — §5c.1) | `repos.*` | Sibling-repo roots used by scripts, agents, and tooling | `machine-local get repos.<name>` |
| Publish-target mirrors | `publish.mirrors.*` | OSS mirror DEST roots — outward push only, never working trees | `machine-local get publish.mirrors.<key>.path` |
| Engine working-repo discriminant (§5c.3) | `engine.working_repos.*` | The (much narrower) set of repos that work ON the coordinator engine and must resolve the live claude-klabauter checkout, not the published engine | `machine-local get engine.working_repos.<slug>` |

**Why distinct namespaces, not a class attribute on `repos.*`?** Distinct namespaces make the publish→working-repo clobber guard structural: claude-klabauter `coordinator/bin/publish.py` reads only the mirror namespace, so it can never accidentally resolve a working repo as a publish destination. The clobber risk is documented at `plugin-extraction-and-distribution.md:87` and `live-install-drift-audit.md:21`.

The read-side surface for this namespace is the SessionStart boot banner: `_engine_root.resolve_publish_mirror_roster()` reads every registered `publish.mirrors.*` entry, and `project-orientation.py::engine_resolution_banner()` announces each one unprompted, naming it explicitly as not a peer repo. This closes the read-side half of a mis-attribution the write-side guards (`bump_out_of_repo_tool_write`, `block_oss_mirror_memo_delivery`, and siblings) cannot reach on their own: those guards fire on a write, and an agent that reasons its way to never writing never reaches one.

### Schema shape

Each publish mirror is a nested TOML table split across tracked `registry.toml` (owner + same-on-every-machine values) and gitignored `registry.local.toml` (per-machine absolute path):

```toml
# registry.toml (TRACKED — declarations + shared values)
[publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude]
owner = "claude-central-em"

[publish.mirrors.deep_research_claude]
owner  = "claude-central-em"
aliases = ["deep-research", "deep-research-em"]   # legacy shortnames — not derivable from key

# registry.local.toml (GITIGNORED — per-machine absolute paths)
[publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude]
path = "/abs/path/to/coordinator-claude"

[publish.mirrors.deep_research_claude]
path = "/abs/path/to/deep-research-claude"
```

### `publish-mirror:` sigil in `setup/publish-targets.portable`

Portable rows use `publish-mirror:<key>` in field 3. The resolver (claude-klabauter `coordinator/bin/publish-resolve-target.py`) routes that sigil exclusively through `machine-local get publish.mirrors.<key>.path` — no `repos.*` read occurs in that branch. The legacy `repo:` branch is retained for backward-compat, but any residual `repo:coordinator_claude` / `repo:deep_research_claude` row rc1-fails because those `repos.*` keys do not exist.

### Migrating an existing machine

Run the idempotent migration subcommand once:

```bash
machine-local migrate-publish-mirrors
```

This moves `repos.coordinator_claude` / `repos.deep_research_claude` values (and the legacy `repos.deep_research` alias) into `[publish.mirrors.*].path` tables, removes the old `repos.*` keys, and rewrites `repo:<mirror>` rows in any machine-local `publish.targets` registry array. Re-run is a no-op once migrated. For legacy `publish-targets.sh` fallback files the subcommand emits loud operator-remediation instead of editing the gitignored file automatically.

### Namespace-stability invariant (F6)

`publish` MUST remain a **registry namespace** (keys in `registry.toml` / `registry.local.toml`) and must NOT be promoted to a concern file. If `publish` is ever added to the `concerns` array, `_clean_registry` (`_machine_local.py:234-244`) will silently drop every `publish.mirrors.*` and `publish.targets` registry entry with no error. Any proposal to add a `publish.toml` concern file must be treated as a breaking change to this architecture and requires an explicit decision record.

### Distinct from `plugin.mirrors.*`

`plugin.mirrors.*` is the live-install source→live propagation namespace (example-game-repo-control, coordinator-claude, etc.) — a separate concept entirely. Do not confuse the two:

| Namespace | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `plugin.mirrors.*` | Live-install drift tracking (source→live propagation mode + paths) | §12 |
| `publish.mirrors.*` | OSS publish-target DEST roots (outward push, never live-install) | this section |

### `$REPO_COORDINATOR_CLAUDE` / `$REPO_DEEP_RESEARCH_CLAUDE` env exports

The `claude-machine-local.sh` shell helper exports `$REPO_<NAME>` for every `repos.*` key. `repos.coordinator_claude` and `repos.deep_research_claude` are not in `repos.*` (they are publish DEST keys, never dev-tooling source paths; no active consumers of those env exports exist), so `$REPO_COORDINATOR_CLAUDE` and `$REPO_DEEP_RESEARCH_CLAUDE` are intentionally absent from the helper's export set. Where the publish DEST path is needed, use `machine-local get publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude.path` / `machine-local get publish.mirrors.deep_research_claude.path` directly.

## 5c.3. `engine.working_repos.*` — Engine Working-Repo Discriminant

`engine.working_repos.*` answers a narrower question than either namespace above: *does THIS repo work ON the coordinator engine (klabauter) — build it, develop it, dispatch against its live source — such that it must execute the live `claude-klabauter` checkout rather than the published engine artifact?* It is a third, disjoint namespace alongside `repos.*` (§5c.1) and `publish.mirrors.*` (§5c.2), not a subset or relabeling of either.

**Purpose.** `claude-klabauter` is the published coordinator engine every consumer repo resolves. Two repos do not consume it — they *work on* it: `claude-klabauter` (the engine's own source) and `DoE-claude` (the doctrine/plugin source that co-develops against it). Those two sessions must keep resolving the live claude-klabauter checkout, never the published artifact, or engine changes under development would be invisible to the very repos developing them. `engine.working_repos.*` is the explicit, checkable set that makes that discrimination possible.

**Key shape.** `engine.working_repos.<repo_slug> = "<abs-path>"`, one key per engine-working repo. Currently two: `engine.working_repos.claude_klabauter`, `engine.working_repos.doe_claude`. The tracked `registry.toml.example` (§ machine-local template) carries only the empty-string declarations — never absolute paths, same convention as every other coordinator-owned per-machine key.

**Who writes it.** Target state: each engine-working repo's OWN installer, at install time — the installer already knows its own root (it's the repo running the install), so it writes its own key via an idempotent `machine-local set engine.working_repos.<slug> <path>` call. Current state is per-key: `claude_klabauter` is written this way today, by `register_claude_klabauter_root()` in `claude-klabauter`'s `scripts/setup.py`. `doe_claude` is written a different way, not "NOT written": `coordinator/hooks/scripts/session-start-register-doe-claude-root.py`, a DoE-resident `async: true` SessionStart hook (`coordinator/hooks/hooks.json`), idempotently self-heals it every session rather than only at install time — it reads the current value first and does nothing when already correct, and otherwise shells out to the same sanctioned `machine-local set` writer. Guarded against registering the wrong tree by the repo-root `.coordinator-dev-repo` sentinel (`slug: doe-claude` content match), which is structurally absent from every OSS/consumer install, and otherwise writes via the same `_machine_local.py` implementation the `machine-local set` CLI resolves to (invoked directly under `sys.executable`, not through the CLI shim, so the hook doesn't depend on the shim being present/executable). Contrast with `repos.*`, whose values are the OPERATOR's knowledge of *other* repos' layout and cannot be self-written by the target repo.
<!-- Review: code-reviewer-b1042315 — F5: blanket "each repo's own installer writes it" was untrue for doe_claude; scoped per-key. -->

**Regeneratability.** `idempotent-regeneratable` is the target class for the whole namespace — NOT `session-accumulated-must-survive-crash` like `repos.*`. For `claude_klabauter`, this holds today: re-running its installer regenerates the value with no human input and no state loss, because the installer is authoritative about its own root by construction. For `doe_claude`, this now also holds: every session's SessionStart hook re-derives and, if needed, rewrites the key from this repo's own `__file__`-resolved root, so a wiped registry or a fresh clone self-heals on the next session with no human input (gated on the repo-root sentinel, see above). This is the same reasoning class as `coordinator.python` (rewritten by `ensure_venv`), not the class as `repos.*` (which encodes operator knowledge of someone else's layout and has no self-writer).

**Consumer.** Engine resolution — specifically the working-tree-vs-published-artifact gate in `coordinator/hooks/scripts/_engine_root.py`'s `resolve_claude_klabauter_root_with_class()` / `_is_engine_working_repo()`. Wired at `972eb5d06`; `_resolve_published_engine()` has a producer — it reads `repos.claude_klabauter`, written at install time by the published mirror's own installer (`scripts/setup.py::register_claude_klabauter_root()`, commit `5080edc48d3f`) — so the divert branch is live on any machine where that key is registered. On a machine with no `repos.claude_klabauter` registration, the ladder still degrades to pre-gate behaviour.
<!-- Review: code-reviewer-b1042315 — F1: paragraph was stale ("not yet wired") after 972eb5d06 wired the gate fail-open; also fixed the misattributed function name. -->

**`_is_engine_working_repo() is False` is one of two divert co-conditions, not the sole gate.** The
divert condition is a disjunction: `published and (target_is_readable or
_is_engine_working_repo() is False)`, where `target_is_readable` reads a SEPARATE key,
`engine.target` (not part of this namespace — see the engine plane's own targeting contract),
through `_resolve_engine_target()`. This namespace's own key (`engine.working_repos.*`) and its
consumer (`_is_engine_working_repo()`) are otherwise unaffected; the gate that reads it has a
second, independent way to fire, so a repo registered in `engine.working_repos.*` (this
namespace's own discriminant) can still be diverted when `engine.target` is readable, even though
`_is_engine_working_repo()` itself refuses. The other disjunct is pending retirement, gated on the
engine plane's `engine.target` write running live for a cycle. See DR-132 § Consequences for the
fuller anti-strand argument and the retirement gating.


**Why not `repos.*`?** See the disambiguation note at the top of §5c.1 — `repos.*` is sibling-repo discovery (broad, ~19 keys on a reference machine, mostly consumer repos), not the engine-working set (narrow, exactly 2). A design that reads `repos.*` membership as "works on the engine" produces false positives for every consumer repo. See `docs/wiki/coordinator-tripwires/` for the incident.

**Schema authorship.** Per §5a's ruling (the "Schema authorship" bullet, line ~324) that shared key-namespace schema — what keys exist and what they mean — is coordinator-team-owned, this namespace (its key shape, meaning, and regeneratability class) is authored here in DoE-claude, the doctrine plane — even though its writers are claude-klabauter-resident and DoE-claude-resident installers, and its consumer is currently unimplemented.

## 5c.4. Role-key indirection — a value that names another registry key

Every namespace above stores a **path**. A key may instead store a **registry key**, resolving in two hops: role key → `repos.<that key>` → filesystem path. First instance: claude-klabauter's `tracker.holder_repo = "example_store_repo"`, which names `repos.example_store_repo`, not a path.

```toml
tracker.holder_repo = "example_store_repo"    # names a repos.<key>, NOT a path
```

**Use it when the value is a role assignment, not a location.** "Which repo holds the tracker?" and "where is that repo?" are two questions; storing the answer as a path fuses them, duplicates a location already under registry management, and reduces repo identity to a string comparison. The indirection keeps identity checkable and leaves one source of truth for the path.

**Contract for any key of this shape:**

- **Name it `<concern>.<role>_repo`.** The `_repo` suffix is the declaration that the value is a `repos.<key>`; a reader that sees a path there has a mis-set key, not a variant form.
- **Target an enumerated family.** The named key must exist in `repos.*`. That bounds the resolvable set to the registry's own enumeration — the same admission bound wire-supplied targeting cannot satisfy, which is why a raw path in this position is not merely redundant but a widened boundary.
- **Operator-set only, never auto-seeded.** Auto-seeding picks the role-holder on the operator's behalf — the one decision the key exists to make explicit. (Distinct from `engine.working_repos.*`, §5c.3, which a repo's own installer self-writes because it is authoritative about its own root; no writer is authoritative about who holds a role.)
- **Fail loud on an unresolvable target.** A role key naming a `repos.<key>` that is absent is an operational failure (`2`), not a clean absence (`1`) — §4.1.
- **Env override comes free.** `MACHINE_LOCAL_<KEY>` (§4) resolves the role key with both hops intact. Do not add a bespoke absolute-path env var alongside it: a one-line export that bypasses both hops is an ungated route around the boundary the key exists to hold.

**Keep the key under the concern that owns the role, not a `roles.*` family.** This registry namespaces by the question a key answers (§5c.1/5c.2/5c.3), and a role has no reader in common with other repos' roles — a shared family would bag unrelated keys behind a name that describes their shape rather than their subject. The pattern is a value shape; it is not a namespace.

## 5c.5. Publish-mirror channels — a branch on the mirror clone, never a registry key

A publish **channel** is the mirror clone's checked-out **branch**. No
`publish.mirrors.<key>.channel` field and no `engine.*` selection key exists — that absence in
§5c.2 is deliberate, not a gap. The ladder resolves a path and stores no ref (`_engine_root.py:640-646`,
`:620-623`), and its zero-spawn mandate means it could not verify one.

`repos.claude_klabauter` therefore pins a **location, never a revision**: checking the mirror out
on another branch switches every session on the machine to those bits at once. Intended under
whole-machine dogfooding; not per-session opt-outable.

Two consequences:

- That clone is usually also `publish.mirrors.claude_klabauter.path` (distinct keys, same directory
  — `_engine_root.py:404-412`), so checking it out to receive a publish also flips every consumer.
  Only the publish path asserts the expected ref; the resolver never will.
- A branch missing `coordinator_core/`, or a clone caught mid-checkout, fails the rung: a consumer
  box degrades to `unresolved`, a mixed box (consumer plus a reachable live tree) falls back to the
  **live working tree**, and an engine-working repo is unaffected because it never consumes the
  published engine. Publish-time refusal covers that door; a manual checkout or promotion race does
  not. Put it on the list when a session is unexpectedly running live-tree bits or resolving none.

Declare a required ref as `publish.mirrors.<key>.track_ref` (§12's name, one vocabulary; absent
defaults to the remote default). Read by publish and diagnostics, never by the ladder. Channel
metadata must not move to a `publish.toml` concern file — F6 in §5c.2 explains what that drops.
Render the word as **branch** in banners; "channel" is already a comms term here.

## 5c. Coordinator-owned Keys — Reference

Keys authored by coordinator infrastructure (not user-set). These are registered in tracked `registry.toml` as empty-value declarations; per-machine values are written to `registry.local.toml` by the named script.

| Key | Writer | Consumer | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coordinator.python` | operator, or `coordinator_core.install.ensure_venv` when the value needs repair | direct consumers of the resolution contract below (`COORDINATOR_PYTHON` env / registry / PATH — no shared lib since `lib/resolve-python.sh`'s retirement in the bash-kill campaign) | Absolute path to the **general** coordinator interpreter on this machine — the one an operator deliberately chooses. `ensure_venv` writes it only when it is unset, already names the venv python, carries the doubled `/.claude/.claude/` marker, or fails interpreter validation; a healthy value naming anything else survives an install run untouched. Hand-setting it is therefore supported, and is the seam that makes the venv retirement reachable. |
| `coordinator.whoami_python` | — RETIRED — | — | Retired along with `coordinator_whoami` (`archive/specs/2026-08-23-retire-coordinator-whoami-entirely.md`). A value under this key in a live registry is inert; safe to leave or clear, never re-provisioned. |
| `coordinator.machine_slug` | `coordinator:install` (eager seed); `/workday-start` Step 0 (lazy self-heal) | `coordinator_core.machine_resolver` (`compute_machine`; de-bash campaign, unit "daily-branch" — `coordinator-daily-branch.sh` retired) | The canonical machine token used in daily branch names (`work/{machine}/{date}`). Classification: `idempotent-regeneratable` — seeded from `cs_compute_machine_live` (hostname-derived) at a known-good moment; re-seeded by `/workday-start` on any pre-seed install. Drift vs. live hostname is surfaced by `/workday-start` Step 0 (detect-then-fail-loud, not silent overwrite). Never inherit from an existing branch name or substrate label — see `docs/wiki/daily-branch-discipline.md § Machine-token derivation`. |
| `coordinator.contributor_slug` | `coordinator:install` (silent absent-only eager seed); `/workday-start` Step 0 (lazy self-heal) | `coordinator_core.machine_resolver` (`compute_contributor` / `compute_contributor_live`; de-bash campaign, unit "daily-branch" — `coordinator-daily-branch.sh` retired) | **SCOPE (read this before building on the key):** a BRANCH-NAMING and shard token, structurally mirroring `coordinator.machine_slug`'s `{machine}` axis. It is NOT the human-identity axis. The identity axis is engine-subject and lives in claude-klabauter: `coordinator_core.person_resolver.resolve_operating_person()`, surfaced as the `human_owner`/`human_assignee`/`human_claimant` contract fields and authored at the creation and claim doors. Claude-klabauter explicitly forbids extending `compute_contributor` into identity use — it "slugs an email for branch naming, joined to nothing, never reaches frontmatter" and is "NOT this axis's value space" (`coordinator_core/person_resolver.py` § Anti-scope, `archive_stamp.py:1825-1828`). Note the two resolvers disagree by design: this one falls back to `"unknown"`, while the identity axis writes NO field when unresolvable (DEC-41). Do not join them. **Resolver precedence (four-tier, most-specific first):** (1) `$COORDINATOR_CONTRIBUTOR` env escape valve (persisting it is discouraged — it silently masks registry-key drift detection, exactly like `$COORDINATOR_MACHINE`, see §4 above); (2) `coordinator.contributor_slug` registry key (canonical); (3) sanitized git `user.email` local-part (seed source only); (4) `"unknown"`. **Charset:** resolved slugs MUST match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` — enforced by the same bash port of the `_memo_filename` sanitize idiom used elsewhere (`cross-repo-memo:868-870`: lowercase → collapse non-`[a-z0-9-]` runs to a single dash → collapse consecutive dashes → strip leading/trailing dashes). **Fleet-unique onboarding note:** slugs must be unique across the collaborator fleet; uniqueness is operator-set and drift-surfaced (not enforced structurally) — collision likelihood is LOW per the ratified risk table (`tasks/multi-collaborator-support/D0-ownership-model-RATIFIED.md`), and a collision surfaces via `/workday-start` Step 0's detect-then-fail-loud drift comparator, never a silent pick. **Seed-source demotion / PII note:** git `user.email` is a seed source ONLY — it is PII-bearing (drops the `@domain` half before sanitizing, local-part only) and is never promoted to the canonical key; the registry value, once seeded or operator-set, is authoritative and `user.email` is not re-consulted except as the live/drift comparator. Classification: `idempotent-regeneratable` — seeded from `cs_compute_contributor_live` at a known-good moment (silent, absent-only, never a canonical overwrite); re-derivable with no state loss. **Caveat vs. `machine_slug`:** unlike `machine_slug` (purely hostname-derived, re-derives to the *same* value on every clean re-seed), `contributor_slug`'s seed source is git `user.email`, which can change over the contributor's lifetime — regeneration after key loss recovers the value as of the *current* seed-time email, not necessarily the value that was lost, if the operator's email changed between loss and re-seed. See `docs/plans/2026-07-08-mcollab-01-contributor-slug.md § Design` for the full resolver/seed lifecycle. |

**`coordinator.python` resolution contract.** The coordinator Python resolves in this order: (1) `COORDINATOR_PYTHON` env var (test override), (2) `machine-local get coordinator.python` (registry pin), (3) existing PATH Python as a fallback. Callers apply the order directly; there is no FLOOR shim to source. A stale or broken pin (the path in the registry fails to resolve to a working interpreter) fails loud with a remediation pointing at `coordinator_core.install.ensure_venv` (invoked via `install-substrate.py`). This key names the system interpreter fleet-wide — no venv pointer, split or otherwise; see `docs/wiki/fleet-shared-python-environment.md`. One predicate in `ensure_venv` drives both the mutating write and the `check_only` verdict, so a dry-run cannot drift from a real run.

Tier (3) is the only tier a `hooks.json` `command` field can reach: the harness resolves `command`
before any coordinator code runs, so there is no seam to read `COORDINATOR_PYTHON` or invoke
`machine-local get` ahead of the `CreateProcess` spawn — every hook registration lands on
PATH-fallback unavoidably, not by choice. Tiers (1) and (2) are unchanged and remain the
resolution path for every caller that can reach them; this is not PATH-first promoted over the
registry pin generally. What makes tier (3) correct-by-construction for hooks, despite being a
documented fallback rather than a pin, is that its correctness does not depend on which
interpreter PATH resolves to: `fail_open_launcher.BOOTSTRAP`'s site-packages injection gives
whatever interpreter answers the venv's own distributions, so only a real interpreter — never a
WindowsApps App Execution Alias stub — needs to sit ahead of
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` on PATH. That guarantee is an install-surface property this
contract does not itself provide; it is owned by the installer, claude-klabauter, not this repo.

## 6. Concern-file Convention

Most values belong in the core `registry.toml`. A concern file (`unreal.toml`, `cuda.toml`) is warranted only when a surface meets at least one of:

- More than five keys for that namespace, OR
- Version-multiplexed values (e.g., Unreal 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 each with their own install root), OR
- **Machine-generated write authority** — the file is written by an automated process from declared sources (e.g., `cli.py wire` aggregating each installed addon's `CorpusBand.required_env` declarations), not hand-edited by the operator. Concern-file isolation here is doing different work from the count/version criteria: it separates machine-generated content from operator-edited config so the automated writer's clobber radius can never touch operator-set values, and so the file's `[provenance]` attribution stays co-located with the keys it describes. The criterion gates on the **writer pattern** (registered automated aggregator from declared sources), not on key count or addon presence — a hypothetical addon whose two keys are hand-edited by the operator still belongs in `registry.local.toml`. Worked example: project-rag's `wire` aggregator. Its machine-specific `[env]`/`[provenance]` output (written exclusively from each installed addon's declared sources; loud-fail on cross-addon key collision; `[provenance]` records addon→key attribution that the predecessor `wiring.env` lost) lands in the **untracked** `project_rag.local.toml` — per §9, the corpus paths differ per machine, so they belong in the `.local` layer. The tracked `project_rag.toml` carries only the operator-stable `[addons]` registration (setup Phase 7D). Hand-editing a `wire`-managed key would be silently clobbered on the next addon install — the operator's leverage is via the source declarations, not the concern file.

When a concern file is listed in `registry.toml`'s `concerns` array, that concern's namespace (`unreal.*`, `cuda.*`) is **resolved exclusively from the concern file**. Keys with that prefix in `registry.toml` are ignored and emit a warning — the concern file wins. Put `unreal.*` keys EITHER in the core registry OR in `unreal.toml`, never both. This is a read-resolution rule (avoids silent shadowing for operators), not an ownership/permission rule — see §5a for the schema-authorship-vs-value-writing distinction.

**Registered concern files — reference.**

| Concern name | Tracked baseline | Per-machine values file | Writer | Key namespace | Justification (§6 criterion met) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `unreal` | `unreal.toml` | `unreal.local.toml` | project-rag-ue-addon + example-game-repo installers (multi-writer) | `unreal.*` | Version-multiplexed values (5.3–5.7 install roots) + machine-generated write authority (multi-writer requires `[provenance]` stamping per §12) |
| `project_rag` | `project_rag.toml` | `project_rag.local.toml` | `cli.py wire` aggregator | `env.*` (machine corpus paths) | Machine-generated write authority — single registered aggregator from declared addon sources; loud-fail on cross-addon key collision; `[provenance]` records addon→key attribution |
| `hardware` | `hardware.toml` | `hardware.local.toml` | `lib/detect-hardware.sh` (called by `lib/install-substrate.py` on install; single writer) | `hardware.*` | Machine-generated write authority — the install-time hardware audit writes `hardware.cores`, `hardware.ram_gb`, and optionally `hardware.gpu`/`hardware.vram_gb` from declared system sources; values differ per machine (not operator-editable); idempotent re-audit on re-run. |

**`hardware` concern — shape and lifecycle.** The concern follows the same two-file split as `unreal`:

- **Tracked `hardware.toml` schema baseline** — copy-if-not-exist at install time (same `install-substrate.py` logic as the `unreal.toml` baseline at lines 96-98). Contains the key declarations for the concern namespace; no machine-specific values. Travels via git so the key shape is discoverable across machines.
- **Gitignored `hardware.local.toml` machine values** — written (and upserted on re-run) by `lib/detect-hardware.sh` via `machine-local set --concern hardware hardware.cores <n>` etc. (the `--concern` writer from the machine-local-concern-set-writer plan, commit `210fa58a`). Values are regeneratability class `idempotent-regeneratable` (§13) — lost values are recovered by re-running `lib/install-substrate.py` or the OSS `setup/install.sh --setup-only`.
- **Concern registration** — `registry.toml`'s `concerns` array includes `"hardware"` so that `machine-local get hardware.*` resolves from `hardware.local.toml` rather than falling through to the core registry. The install-substrate.py migration step (AC10) performs a TOML-aware upsert to add `"hardware"` to the `concerns` array on existing installs where the entry is absent.
- **Doctor probe** — the hardware-absence probe registered in `bin/doctor-probes.toml` detects missing `hardware.cores`/`hardware.ram_gb` and emits population-aware remediation: "run coordinator:install Phase 3" for coordinator-install users; "re-run setup/install.sh" for OSS users. See `coordinator-doctor.md` for the probe narrative.

**Writing concern-namespace keys via the CLI — `machine-local set --concern`.** The bare `machine-local set <key> <value>` writer REFUSES concern-namespace keys (the concern file owns the namespace; a bare `set unreal.x` redirects to the concern owner). To set an individual concern scalar without hand-editing the TOML or running a concern owner's full seeder, use the explicit opt-in:

```bash
machine-local set --concern unreal unreal.samples_root /x/LyraStarterGame
```

The writer resolves `<name>.local.toml`, validates the key is under the `<name>.` namespace (rejects cross-concern pollution; rejects mixed-case keys fail-loud), performs an atomic read-merge-write that preserves every co-writer key/table **with its scalar type intact** (the DR-CONTRACT-001 witness integer `unreal.emit_shape_version` round-trips as an int, not a string — see §12), and stamps `[provenance.<bare_key>]` with `written_by = machine-local`, `source = cli:--concern`. This is purely additive: bare `set` still refuses concern keys (the negative-spec is preserved; `--concern` is the explicit carve-out). A concern owner's own seeder (e.g. project-rag-ue-addon's `_seed_unreal_keys.py --set`) remains valid as a seeder-local shortcut. Spec: cross-repo memo `2026-06-23-machine-local-concern-set-writer.md`; `docs/plans/2026-06-23-machine-local-concern-set-writer.md`.

**Extension path (per the Director of Engineering review, F7).** If a future need for per-repo metadata (kind, role, version, consumer-set) emerges, the extension path is a new concern file (e.g., `repos_meta.toml`), not restructuring the flat `repos.*` namespace. The flat namespace is correct for the current consumer set (sibling-repo roots are strings, not structured objects). YAGNI: add the concern file if and when the need is concrete; this note just records that the extension path exists so a future contributor does not feel forced to restructure the baseline.

**When the "wait for instance #3" rule applies vs. when it doesn't.** Per `docs/wiki/ceremony-calibration.md`, conventions wait for the third instance before being extracted into a shared abstraction — single instances of a pattern are routinely premature to generalize. The machine-local registry itself appears to break that rule (four EM reinventions surfaced in the triggering plan's §1.2). It does not, because the rule's exception is precisely the case it surfaced: the rule prevents premature abstraction when you have *one* instance and might invent a *second* speculatively; it does NOT prevent abstraction when you already have *N≥2* instances and one of them is in active wrong-shape arrangement because the abstraction never existed. The four-reinvention pattern + the wrong-shape `wiring.env`-style accumulation was the empirical signal; the rule held perfectly. Document this distinction when proposing similar substrate-gap-driven extractions.

**Concern loader — two operational notes.**

- **`schema` is a per-file meta-key, not a queryable value.** Every concern file carries `schema = 1` at its root to declare the file-format version. The reader's `_flatten_concern` helper intentionally skips this key — `machine-local get unreal.schema` (or `<any-concern>.schema`) always returns not-found, regardless of what is written in the file. This is by design, not a loader failure. Do not file bugs when `<concern>.schema` resolves not-found.

- **A missing concern emits a fail-loud warning (not silent not-found).** If a concern is listed in `registry.toml`'s `concerns=[...]` array but neither `<concern>.toml` nor `<concern>.local.toml` can be loaded (files absent, unreadable, or empty), the reader emits a stderr warning of the form `machine-local: warning: concern '<name>' is registered in concerns=[...] but neither '<name>.toml' nor '<name>.local.toml' could be loaded ... Refresh the install or remove it from concerns.` The concern's keys resolve not-found, but the misconfiguration is surfaced, not silent. This is the correct failure mode per coordinator doctrine: detect-then-fail-loud, never detect-then-silently-ignore.

## 7. Reader Contract — Intentionally Minimal

The reader (`machine-local`) returns string values. No nested types. No per-key schemas. No built-in validation beyond TOML parse and schema version check.

This is a deliberate choice: the substrate is a flat string-typed key/value store. If your consumer needs structured values (a list of targets, a typed enum), parse the string in your consumer. The reader stays small so every language and script environment can call it without ceremony.

The reader is **read-only**. It never writes, never caches to disk, never mutates the registry. Write authority belongs to the operator, always.

### DoE ruling — malformed input: isolate on read, still validate on write; the two are not substitutes

**Ruling: BOTH — reader isolation AND write-time round-trip validation — but they are not substitutes for each other, and isolation is the load-bearing half.** See `cross-repo/inbox/2026-08-03-project-rag-ue-addon-em-machine-local-rulings-still-outstanding.md` for the requesting memo.

**Fail soft on read, loud on write.** That one line is the governing shape for this whole seam.

- **A malformed concern file degrades only its own layer.** `machine-local` warns on stderr and drops that one file — every other concern, and every other layer of the resolution chain, still resolves. This is blast-radius containment, not validation: the reader is not being asked to *understand* the malformed file, only to *survive* it. Consistent with §7's minimal-reader contract above — the reader still does no per-key schema checking; it just does not let one bad file take down unrelated concerns.
- **A malformed `registry.toml` / `registry.local.toml` stays a hard failure.** These two files ARE the root namespace — there is no sibling layer to isolate against. A soft-failing registry read would silently answer every query from a partial registry, which is worse than refusing to answer at all. The asymmetry with concern-file isolation is deliberate: concern files have an unaffected sibling to fall back to; the root registry does not.
- **Write-time round-trip validation is the complement, and is explicitly the weaker half on its own.** It protects only against writers you control — the failure that motivated this ask came from a hand-edited concern file, which no writer-side check ever sees. Read-side isolation is what actually contains that failure mode; write-side validation is what keeps `machine-local set --concern` (§5b case 3, §6) from producing a bad file in the first place. Neither one covers the other's gap: write validation doesn't see a hand-edit made outside the CLI, and read isolation doesn't stop a bad write from happening — it only stops a bad *file* from taking down its neighbors once it exists.

**Implementation.** The isolation seam (a `_load_toml_isolated` helper distinguishing "malformed, drop this layer" from "absent, treat as empty" in the per-concern resolution loop) and the round-trip write validation (`_cmd_set_concern`'s reparse-and-compare check) both live in `coordinator/templates/bin/_machine_local.py`. See the concern-loader operational notes above (§6) for the existing "missing concern → fail-loud warning" behavior this isolation seam extends to the malformed case specifically.

*Corroboration:* the requesting memo independently reached the same conclusion — reader isolation as the higher-value half, write validation as a good-but-weaker complement — offered as input to this ruling, not its basis.

## Ergonomic helpers

Three thin wrappers over `machine-local` make the registry-correct shape shorter than the hardcoded literal (Python, shell, PowerShell). All shell out to the reader CLI — they do NOT import `_machine_local.py` directly (per §8(a) and `docs/wiki/dual-identity-module-hazard.md`).

**Python** — `<settings-home>/bin/claude_machine_local.py` (§4e; nothing is minted at `~/.claude/bin/claude_machine_local.py`):

```python
from claude_machine_local import repos
config_path = repos.project_rag / "subdir/file.toml"
```

Missing keys raise `AttributeError` with a remediation message. Process-local memoization amortizes the ~50ms shell-out cost.

**Shell** — source once per session:

```sh
source <settings-home>/bin/claude-machine-local.sh
echo "$REPO_PROJECT_RAG/subdir/file.py"
```

Exports `$REPO_<NAME>` for every declared `repos.*` key — prefix is singular `REPO_`, not `REPOS_`. Hyphens and dots in keys both normalize to underscores (`repos.project-rag` → `REPO_PROJECT_RAG`); identifiers that fail POSIX validation are skipped with a stderr warning.

> **Ratification (DR-087).** `REPO_<REPO_ID>` is the fleet's canonical env-override family for `repos.*` keys — `docs/decisions/DR-087-repo-repo-id-env-override-family-ratified.md`. **This helper's ambient export is the sanctioned pattern, not a violation**: the value comes live from the registry ladder at source time, so it cannot diverge from what rung 1 exists to override, and §4b's `[[ -z ]]` guard still lets an operator-pre-set value win. §4 carries the provenance-not-ambience discriminant and the historical named case (`claude-doe-shim.sh.tmpl`; see DR-087's addendum). Legacy `*_ROOT` names (`DOE_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_KLABAUTER_ROOT`) stay readable indefinitely as permanent alias-reads — no rename, no removal schedule — but are retired from documentation; new doctrine and resolvers cite `REPO_<REPO_ID>` only.

## 8. Anti-patterns

**(a) Importing the registry as a Python module by absolute path.** Do not do `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("machine_local", "/path/to/_machine_local.py")` or equivalents. Python-importable resolvers reintroduce the dual-identity failure mode: importing the same `.py` file under two different module identities yields two copies in `sys.modules` with separate state. Read `docs/wiki/dual-identity-module-hazard.md` before proposing a Python-importable `machine_local` package. The correct reader contract is shell-out: `machine-local get <key>`.

**(b) Writing to machine-local from an MCP server or daemon.** The writer is the operator, always — for `registry.toml`, `registry.local.toml`, and any concern file whose lifecycle is operator-edit. An MCP server or background daemon that writes to those files is acting outside its authority. The explicit carve-out is concern files that satisfy §6's machine-generated-write-authority criterion: those have a single registered writer (e.g., `cli.py wire`) that IS the authority for that file, declared sources, and well-defined clobber semantics. The anti-pattern is unauthorized writes to operator-edited config; sanctioned writes by a registered writer to its own concern file are §6 by construction. If your tool needs to persist runtime-discovered state and you do NOT have §6's writer-pattern shape, write it somewhere under the relevant plugin's data directory instead.

The `machine-local set --concern` CLI writer (§6) is NOT an exception to this rule — it is the operator's own hands at the CLI, the same authority that hand-edits the file, just atomic and provenance-stamping. The writer-is-the-operator invariant holds; an MCP server or daemon shelling out to `set --concern` to persist runtime state would still be the §8(b) anti-pattern (the operator is not in the loop).

**(c) Adding a value that varies per-project.** Per-project state (project root, project type, enabled plugins, skill overrides) belongs in the project's `.claude/` config, not in machine-local. Machine-local is scoped to the machine, not the project; a value that changes when you switch projects is not per-machine.

**(d) Adding a value that varies per-runtime-invocation.** Values that change with each tool invocation — current binding, active corpus, daemon PID — belong in live MCP introspection. See §2 and `docs/wiki/plugin-identity-and-health-sentinels.md`.

**(e) Adding a value that is universal across machines.** If the value is the same on every machine the operator runs (e.g., a fixed public URL, a schema version constant, a vendor SDK that always installs to the OS-canonical location), commit it to the relevant repo. Git-tracked durability is the right primitive; no operator action needed per machine.

**(f) Putting machine-specific path values in `registry.toml` instead of `registry.local.toml`.** `registry.toml` is git-tracked and travels with the `~/.claude` repo across machines. If you bake `repos.example_game_workbench_repo = "E:/dev/example-game-workbench-repo"` into `registry.toml`, that path is wrong on every other machine the operator uses. <!-- foreign-path-ok: illustrative anti-pattern example, the subject of this rule --> Machine-specific values go in `registry.local.toml`, which is gitignored. See §9 for the full split rationale and the Machine-a-and-Mac worked example. **This stays a documented convention, not a reader-enforced constraint — see §9's 2026-08-03 DoE ruling before proposing read-time rejection.**

## 9. Tracked Baseline + `.local` Overrides — Why and When

`~/.claude/` is git-trackable, and operators are encouraged to treat it that way (established practice on the PM's machines; documented as a recommendation for OSS adopters in the coordinator setup material). The registry composes with that:

- `registry.toml` (and any `<concern>.toml`) is **tracked** — carries the shared baseline: key declarations, `schema = 1`, the `concerns` list, and values that hold across all of the operator's machines.
- `registry.local.toml` (and `<concern>.local.toml`) is **gitignored** — carries per-machine path values. These are the values that differ across the operator's machines.

This matches the `*.local.*` precedent already established at `~/.claude/`: the (now-removed) `the (now-removed) meta-repo local-doctrine file`, `coordinator.local.md`, `settings.local.json`. The `.local` convention is consistent throughout the install tree.

**Worked example — Machine-a and Mac.** The operator runs from Machine-a (Windows, repos under `X:/...`) and a Mac on the go (repos under `~/work/...`). <!-- foreign-path-ok: worked example of real per-machine registry.local.toml values, the subject of this section --> One git-tracked `~/.claude` repo lives on both machines. `registry.toml` is identical on both — it declares `repos.project_rag`, `repos.example-sim-repo`, etc. as keys, sets `schema = 1`, lists `concerns`. On Machine-a, `registry.local.toml` contains:

```toml
"repos.project_rag" = "X:/project-rag"    # <!-- foreign-path-ok: worked-example registry.local.toml value -->
"repos.example-sim-repo"    = "E:/dev/example-sim-repo"   # <!-- foreign-path-ok: worked-example registry.local.toml value -->

[publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude]
path = "X:/coordinator-claude"    # <!-- foreign-path-ok: worked-example registry.local.toml value -->

[publish.mirrors.deep_research_claude]
path = "X:/deep-research-claude"    # <!-- foreign-path-ok: worked-example registry.local.toml value -->
```

On the Mac, `registry.local.toml` contains:

```toml
"repos.project_rag" = "~/work/project-rag"

[publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude]
path = "~/work/coordinator-claude"
```

Same keys, different machine-specific values, no manual reconciliation, no merge conflicts — `.local.toml` is gitignored on both ends so it never appears in the shared history. Single-machine operators ignore the `.local` layer entirely; it is opt-in by virtue of the file simply not existing unless the operator creates it. Note that publish mirror paths follow the same `.local.toml` convention but live under `[publish.mirrors.*]` nested tables (§5c.2) rather than flat `repos.*` keys.

### DoE ruling — relax: the tracked/`.local` split stays a documented convention, never a read-time rejection

**Ruling: RELAX.** §8(f)'s anti-pattern statement stands, but it does NOT become a reader-enforced constraint. The `machine-local` reader never rejects a machine-specific-shaped value it finds in tracked `registry.toml`; it just resolves it, per §4's ordinary precedence chain.

**Why hard enforcement buys no correctness.** A machine-specific path baked into `registry.toml` (§8(f)'s own worked example) is *wrong on other machines*, not *unreadable on this one*. The reader has no way to tell an operator-stable path (correctly tracked) from a machine-specific one (mis-tracked) — both are syntactically valid strings. Enforcing at read time would make the reader adjudicate a convention it structurally cannot evaluate, which also contradicts §7's minimal-reader contract: "no per-key schemas, no built-in validation beyond TOML parse and schema version check."

**Why it would actively break operators.** Hard rejection would fail mid-migration for any operator moving a value from tracked to `.local` (or vice versa, per §11's untracking sweep) — the exact operators the convention exists to help. A read-time hard failure punishes the migration path more than it deters the mistake it's meant to catch.

**The §6 worked example is the convention operating correctly, cited as the positive case.** Project-rag's `wire` aggregator writes machine-specific `[env]`/`[provenance]` to the **untracked** `project_rag.local.toml`, while the **tracked** `project_rag.toml` carries only the operator-stable `[addons]` registration (enabled-flags, not a per-machine path) — see §5b case 3 and §6. No reader enforcement was needed for this to work; the writer-side discipline (declared sources, single registered writer) already keeps the split correct.

**Sanctioned future shape, if enforcement ever lands: write-time, never read-time.** A **warning** at `machine-local set` when a machine-specific-shaped value targets the tracked file is the only sanctioned enforcement shape — narrow, advisory, and at the point where the operator can act on it. A read-time hard failure is out of scope permanently, not merely deferred; do not re-open this as an oversight in a later session.

*Corroboration:* the requesting memo's own leaning (`cross-repo/inbox/2026-08-03-project-rag-ue-addon-em-machine-local-rulings-still-outstanding.md`) independently reached the same conclusion — offered as input to this ruling, not its basis. This answers the 2026-07-15 ask that went unaddressed for three weeks.

### 9a. Registry resolution reads `registry.local.toml` by VALUE, not `registry.toml` by EXISTENCE

<!-- spec-backlink: archive/completed/2026-07/2026-07-12-wsc-d536a9d1-b12d-4e3a-8c37-dadf6b20bd46.md — synth run 2026-08-06-14h38, nugget c5-003 -->

**A rename/migration plan cannot infer the resolver's behavior from whether `registry.toml` (tracked) *exists*.** The resolver reads `registry.local.toml` **by value**: it opens the per-machine gitignored file and resolves whatever key/value pairs are actually present there, per the §4 precedence chain (rung 3, above the tracked baseline at rung 4). Existence of the tracked file is not the signal; the *content* of the local override is. A rename or re-key of a `repos.*`/`publish.mirrors.*` entry must edit `registry.local.toml`'s value directly (e.g. via `machine-local set`) — touching or recreating `registry.toml` alone does not re-point the resolved value on a machine that already has a local override set.

This is a **misdiagnosis-prevention note**, not a new resolution rule — §4's rungs and §9's tracked/`.local` split already describe the correct mechanics; this entry exists so a future rename/migration plan doesn't re-derive the wrong premise from scratch. The same workstream also surfaced two unrelated pre-existing coordinator-tooling bugs while re-keying the registry: a `walkGlob` crash on an undefined `globPattern`, fixed with a fail-loud guard at `queryRecords()` (commit `17fcc557`), and a stale test exercising the pre-migration `lessons.md` format instead of the target `state/lessons/*.yaml` (commit `30c37bd1`) — noted here for provenance only; neither changes machine-local's own contract.

## 10. When NOT to Use `.local`

`.local` is specifically for values that **differ across the operator's machines** — that is the discriminator. If a value is the same on every machine the operator runs, it belongs in `registry.toml` and inherits git-tracked durability for free. Misusing `.local` for stable cross-machine values loses the version-history benefit and forces manual synchronization.

Examples of values that should NOT go in `.local`:

- A vendor SDK that always installs to the OS-canonical location (e.g., `C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v12.4` when all machines run the same Windows CUDA version) — commit to `registry.toml`. <!-- foreign-path-ok: illustrative OS-canonical-location example, the subject of this rule -->
- A publish target URL that is the same on every machine — commit to `registry.toml`.
- A schema version or well-known constant — commit to the relevant repo, not the registry at all.

The test: *"If I cloned `~/.claude` to a second machine right now, would this value be wrong there?"* If yes, `.local.toml`. If no, `registry.toml`.

## 11. Per-project State Directories Under `~/.claude/` — Inventory

Machine-local handles operator-set config (key-value, TOML, reader-mediated). The orthogonal substrate is **per-project state directories** under `~/.claude/<project>/` — bespoke paths each project owns for runtime artifacts (PID files, lockfiles, status JSON, install logs, sentinels) that aren't shaped like key-value config. Two substrates, one canonical root.

**Doctrine (DoE):** The §1.2 namespace-scalability critique of `~/.project-rag/` (per the DoE reply memo, `~/.claude/cross-repo/archive/2026-05-19-machine-local-doe-reply.md` — grandfathered pre-cutoff memo) is content-agnostic. State directories do NOT get a top-level carve-out — `~/.<project>/` is the anti-pattern whether the contents are config or state. State lives under `~/.claude/<project>/` alongside the project's other claude-home artifacts. XDG's `STATE_HOME` vs `CONFIG_HOME` split informs sub-path naming inside the namespace, not separate top-level dirs.

**Registered namespaces:**

| Namespace | Owner | Contents | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `~/.coordinator-claude-settings/` | coordinator | **Settings home** — durable coordinator substrate: `machine-local/` (TOML registry), `bin/` (resolver family), `.coordinator-venv/`, `settings-manifest.md` (`setup/` stays at `~/.claude/setup/` — intentionally NOT migrated by the one-time settings-home migration) | A top-level FS namespace, sibling to `~/.claude`. Redirectable via `COORDINATOR_SETTINGS_HOME` env var; sandbox-safe via `CLAUDE_HOME`. See §4e for the full resolution ladder. |
| `~/.claude/example-game-repo/` | example-game-workbench-repo | install-status.json, install-logs/, setup-state.json; **imminent:** watchdog/status.json, chain-walk-*.json (migrating from `~/.example-game-repo/`) | Collapses the dual-namespace split (`~/.example-game-repo/` + `~/.claude/example-game-repo/`) into the canonical root. See `example-game-workbench-repo/state/memos/2026-05-19-doe-question-example-game-repo-namespace-collapse.md` (grandfathered pre-cutoff memo) |
| `~/.claude/project-rag/` | project-rag host | host runtime state | Existing; predates this doctrine |
| `~/.claude/machine-local/` | coordinator | **Transitional compat symlink only** — realpath-symlink → `~/.coordinator-claude-settings/machine-local/`. Retained for consumers that read the old absolute path; removed at phase-2 gated tail. **Actual content lives at `~/.coordinator-claude-settings/machine-local/`.** | DoE-altitude: claiming this top-level dir is unchanged; it is now a symlink pointer. |
| `~/.claude/plugins/<plugin>/data/` | each plugin | addon-owned on-disk state | Plugin-addressed; orthogonal to top-level project dirs |
| `~/.claude/.coordinator-venv/` | coordinator-claude | **RELOCATED** to `~/.coordinator-claude-settings/.coordinator-venv/`. This path is the legacy location; the actual venv now lives in the settings home. `coordinator.python` registry key points to the new location. | Legacy path removed after venv rebuild confirms healthy. If you see this path, run `/coordinator:install` Phase 3 to rebuild at the settings home. |

**Adding a new top-level FS namespace under `~/.claude/<project>/`.** This is the DoE-altitude call: claiming a top-level directory under `~/.claude/` is an FS-namespace claim that other projects might collide with, and the §1.2 critique of `~/.<project>/` accretion is what this row exists to prevent. Register here in the same commit that creates the directory on disk; PM-authorized.

**Distinct from — adding a TOML key or table inside the registry.** Adding a new key in `registry.local.toml`, opening a new dotted namespace (`mything.*`), or even authoring a new concern file under §6 criteria is NOT DoE-altitude. See §5a (authorship vs. value-writing) and §5b (the cheap path for adding values). The FS-namespace gate here is about *new top-level directories on disk*, not about *content inside the registry's existing namespace*.

**Retiring `~/.<project>/` top-level dirs.** When a project still owns a `~/.<project>/` top-level namespace, migrate to `~/.claude/<project>/` and register here. Operator-visible path migration; one release of relocation logic. The `~/.project-rag/wiring.env` retirement (PM-handled, downstream of this registry shipping) is the worked precedent.

## 12. `plugin.mirrors` — Plugin Live-Install Tracking

<!-- spec-backlink: docs/wiki/plugin-extraction-and-distribution.md:87 (publish.sh direction + 2026-05-20 clobber ban); docs/wiki/live-install-drift-audit.md:21 (drift audit doctrine) -->

The `plugin.mirrors` table namespace registers plugins whose live install may be a separate git checkout of the plugin's source repo. The drift probe (`check-plugin-drift.py`) reads these entries to detect when a live install has fallen behind its source.

**Full schema, field reference, and operator examples live in `<settings-home>/machine-local/README.md § plugin.mirrors`** (§4e; `~/.claude/machine-local/README.md` resolves the same content via the transitional compat symlink during the phase-2 gated migration window) — do not duplicate here. The summary below covers only the doctrine decision points.

**No provenance stamp on `plugin.mirrors.<name>` writes (DoE ruling).** Each `[plugin.mirrors.<name>]` table is repo-namespaced and single-writer — only that plugin's own installer ever writes its table, so the table key already encodes the writer. The `[provenance]` convention (§5b case 3, §6) exists specifically for *multi-writer collision diagnosis* — disambiguating which automated writer set a key several installers can write (e.g. `[provenance.unreal]` on the shared `unreal.install_root`, seeded by more than one installer). It is **not** a universal stamp on every `registry.local.toml` write. A single-writer namespaced table has nothing to disambiguate, so a provenance stamp there is ceremony, not signal. Append-only writers that structurally preserve sibling tables (read → `tomllib`-parse-absent-check → append → atomic `os.replace`) satisfy the preserve-unrelated-tables property by construction and need no provenance. (Triggered by project-rag-em's question on `_register_plugin_mirror.py`.)

**Scope of this ruling — single-writer tables only.** This "no provenance stamp" ruling applies narrowly to **single-writer repo-namespaced tables like `plugin.mirrors.*`**, where the table key already encodes the sole writer. It does **NOT** exempt **multi-writer concern files** (§5b case 3 / §6): those genuinely have several writers contributing keys to one file (`unreal.local.toml` is co-written by project-rag-ue-addon and example-game-workbench-repo per its ownership map), so per-key `[provenance.<key>]` IS the collision-diagnosis signal and is required, not ceremony. The `machine-local set --concern` CLI writer (a third writer of concern keys) stamps `[provenance.<bare_key>]` for exactly this reason. (Clarification: the boundary case of a NEW writer joining an existing multi-writer concern file was unaddressed; prior-art-check on the concern-set-writer plan surfaced the gap.)

### Three modes, three structural shapes

| Mode | When to use | Drift probe behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Default (git-checkout-managed) | Live install is a separate git checkout; source changes must be explicitly propagated via `refresh-plugin-live-install.py` | Checks git-state (commits-behind) and venv-state (editable pin, MAPPING integrity, console-script shims) |
| `propagation_mode = "source_is_live"` | Live install IS the canonical source (e.g., coordinator — both `source_path` and `live_path` point at the same directory; post-2026-07-04 cutover this is the DoE clone `<DoE>/coordinator/` resolved via `--plugin-dir`, not `~/.claude/`) | Emits `[n/a] propagation_mode=source_is_live` and skips all checks |
| `propagation_mode = "copy_install"` | Live install is a file-copy produced by a copy-based installer (e.g., the example-game-repo trio — `example-game-repo`, `example-game-repo-control`, `game-dev`); no git remote in the live path | SHA-sentinel drift class: compares `version.txt` (40-char SHA written by the installer) against `git -C <source_path> rev-parse HEAD`; no git fetch, no venv legs |

### `source_is_live` rationale

For the coordinator plugin, there is no "source → live" propagation step because `source_path` and `live_path` both resolve to the same directory. Registering this with `propagation_mode = "source_is_live"` communicates the structural distinction to the probe so it does not report false drift. Coordinator's `source_is_live` directory is the DoE clone (`<DoE>/coordinator/`), resolved live via `--plugin-dir`; the registry entry's `source_path` and `live_path` both point there. (Historically this was `~/.claude/plugins/coordinator/` — edits in `~/.claude/` took effect immediately.) Outward percolation (`install → publish-repo` via claude-klabauter `coordinator/bin/publish.py`) is a separate concern and unaffected by this entry. For the publish-direction contract (source → publish-repo, never write-back) and the ban on publish-repo → live-install clobber that motivates `source_is_live`, see `plugin-extraction-and-distribution.md:87` and `live-install-drift-audit.md:21`.

### `propagation_mode = "copy_install"`

<!-- spec-backlink: archive/specs/2026-05/2026-05-23-copy-install-drift-coverage.md § Chunk 1 -->

For plugins whose live install is produced by a copy-based installer (rather than a git
checkout), set `propagation_mode = "copy_install"`. The canonical example is the
`example-game-workbench-repo` trio (`example-game-repo`, `example-game-repo-control`, `game-dev`), installed via
`scripts/install-plugin.sh` from the example-game-repo source repo.

**Applicable fields.** `track_ref` and `dist_name` do not apply — no git remote is consulted and no venv editable-install is involved. The fields that apply are:

| Field | Required | Semantics |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| `source_path` | yes | Absolute path to the plugin source repo root (for `git rev-parse HEAD` + locating the installer) |
| `live_path` | yes | Absolute path to the live install directory (for reading `version.txt`) |
| `refresh_cmd` | no | Shell command run from `source_path` to reinstall. If absent, refresh prints the manual path and exits non-zero. |
| `source_subpath` | no | Relative path within `source_path` to the plugin tree (e.g. `plugin/example-game-repo-control`). Used by the content-equivalence fallback to scope `git ls-tree`. Default: `plugin/<plugin_name>` when absent. |

**SHA-sentinel drift class.** This is a distinct third drift class alongside git-state drift
and venv-state drift. The installer writes a 40-char source HEAD SHA to
`<live_path>/version.txt` at copy time. The probe detects drift by comparing:

```
version.txt  (live install at copy time)
    vs.
git -C <source_path> rev-parse HEAD  (currently-checked-out source HEAD — no fetch)
```

Using the local HEAD (not `origin/main`) avoids constant false-positive drift: these plugins
develop on `work/*` branches ahead of main.

**Refresh action.** `refresh-plugin-live-install.py <plugin>` on a `copy_install` entry runs the
registry-supplied `refresh_cmd` from `source_path`, with a snapshot + REPLACE-semantics rollback
on failure. The git-state and venv-state legs are skipped entirely.

```bash
( cd <source_path> && bash -c "<refresh_cmd>" )    # e.g. bash scripts/install-control-plugin.sh --allow-standalone --no-enable
```

The coordinator does **not** hardcode `install-plugin.sh <plugin> --no-enable`: the example-game-repo trio
gates standalone component installs behind `EXAMPLE_GAME_REPO_UMBRELLA_INSTALL=1` (a bare component install
is *refused*), reachable only via the component forwarders' `--allow-standalone` passthrough — and
the docs/umbrella component has no forwarder. The correct invocation is installer-internal
knowledge, so it lives in `refresh_cmd` (operator/installer-supplied, same trust level as the paths
the script already executes against). `--no-enable` bypasses `enable_plugin.py` (the `settings.json`
lock). **If no `refresh_cmd` is registered, refresh prints the manual path (`/example-game-repo:install` or the
per-component forwarder) and exits non-zero — it never silently no-ops or guesses an invocation.**

**No-sentinel state.** If `version.txt` is absent, the probe emits `[info] no sentinel` and
exits 0 — this is honest degraded state, not drift. The sentinel is only written when
`requires_plugin_source_index: true` is set in the plugin manifest; for plugins without it,
`[info] no sentinel` is the expected output until the example-game-repo installer is updated (see
the example-game-repo repo's `cross-repo/2026-05-23-copy-install-drift.md` (example-game-repo pre-restructure root-level placement; will move to cross-repo/inbox/ on next migration) (asks tracked in `docs/plans/2026-05-23-copy-install-drift-coverage.md`)).

**Known limitation.** SHA-sentinel catches **committed drift only**. Uncommitted source edits
are invisible. Content-diff (the only alternative) is a false-positive machine because the
installer injects BOMs into `.ps1` files, copies the marketplace manifest, and strips
`.mcp.json`. The sentinel is the deliberate tradeoff.

**Registration example** (Machine-a, example-game-repo trio):

```bash
machine-local set plugin.mirrors.example-game-repo-control.propagation_mode copy_install
machine-local set plugin.mirrors.example-game-repo-control.source_path X:/example-game-workbench-repo  # <!-- foreign-path-ok: worked registration example, the subject of this section -->
machine-local set plugin.mirrors.example-game-repo-control.live_path "$HOME/.claude/plugins/example-game-workbench-repo/example-game-repo-control"
machine-local set plugin.mirrors.example-game-repo-control.refresh_cmd 'bash scripts/install-control-plugin.sh --allow-standalone --no-enable'
# game-dev: same shape, refresh_cmd → install-game-dev-plugin.sh --allow-standalone --no-enable
# example-game-repo (docs, no forwarder): refresh_cmd → 'EXAMPLE_GAME_REPO_UMBRELLA_INSTALL=1 bash scripts/install-plugin.sh example-game-repo --no-enable'
```

For clean-install reproducibility on a fresh machine, installers should self-register these
entries at install time. See the example-game-repo repo's `cross-repo/2026-05-23-copy-install-drift.md` (example-game-repo pre-restructure root-level placement; will move to cross-repo/inbox/ on next migration) (asks tracked in `docs/plans/2026-05-23-copy-install-drift-coverage.md`)
for the memo requesting this from the example-game-repo installer.

### `reverse_drift_cmd` (reverse-drift merge gate)

`refresh_cmd` polices **forward** drift (source newer than live). `reverse_drift_cmd` polices the
opposite direction: a live install hand-edited *after* the last copy, which the forward-SHA probe
cannot see. It is the per-plugin command that digest-compares live against source and exits non-zero
on a hand-edit. Registered per `copy_install` plugin alongside `refresh_cmd`:

```bash
machine-local set plugin.mirrors.example-game-repo.reverse_drift_cmd 'bash bin/check-reverse-drift.sh'
```

**Invocation contract.** `/workweek-complete` Step 4g discovers registered commands via
`list-reverse-drift-cmds.py` (which reads this registry from any cwd), then runs each from its
`source_path` — the same `( cd <source_path> && bash -c "<reverse_drift_cmd>" )` idiom as `refresh_cmd`.
Because the value is shell-evaluated once by `bash -c`, operators **MUST single-quote** the value in
`registry.local.toml` (the registration example above does). The reader is referenced by its
authoritative absolute path in Step 4g; a cwd-relative path would silently no-op when
`/workweek-complete` runs from the meta-repo cwd — the exact bug per-repo reverse-drift-gate coverage fixed.

**Per-repo scoping (`--scope-repo`).** Step 4g passes the releasing repo's root
(`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) as `--scope-repo`, so the gate is scoped to that repo, **not**
machine-global. The **meta-repo** (`${HOME}/.claude`, the coordinator home) is the explicit check-all
case — releasing it covers every `copy_install` plugin on the machine. Any **consumer repo** (project-rag,
Example-sim-repo, example-repo, …) checks only `copy_install` plugins whose `source_path` IS that repo — usually
none, so a clean no-op. This prevents a consumer-repo release from gating on a *sibling* plugin's
live-install drift, which would violate the dependency-direction invariant (a host must never be forced
to sync with a consumer's state). Path forms are normalized before comparison (Windows `the checkout root` vs MSYS
`/x/` vs `$HOME`-derived `/c/`), <!-- foreign-path-ok: naming the cross-platform path-shape variance this normalization step handles --> so the meta-repo and `source_path` matches survive cross-platform path
representations. Omitting `--scope-repo` (direct callers, tests) retains the legacy emit-all behavior.
The scope filter runs **before** the `copy_install`-seen counter, so a consumer repo that legitimately
sources none of the registered plugins exits `0` (clean), not `3` (misconfig).

**Distinct from `refresh_cmd` on rollback.** `refresh_cmd` runs inside `refresh-plugin-live-install.py`,
which wraps it with snapshot + REPLACE-semantics rollback (it *mutates* the live install). `reverse_drift_cmd`
is a **detection-only read** — it never mutates anything, so it is invoked bare in a loop with no
snapshot/rollback wrapper. Do not route `reverse_drift_cmd` through `refresh-plugin-live-install.py`.
See the `refresh_cmd` contract above (`docs/wiki/machine-local-registry.md`, "Refresh action").

**Fail-loud, never silent.** The reader exits `3` when `copy_install` plugins are registered but none
carry a `reverse_drift_cmd` (the gate would be structurally blind) — Step 4g turns that into a blocking
failure with a registration hint. When no `copy_install` plugins exist at all, the gate is genuinely
N/A and passes cleanly (exit `0`, empty output). Detection logic itself remains example-game-repo-owned
(`example-game-workbench-repo` repo, `bin/check-reverse-drift.sh`; resolve the repo root via `repos.example_game_workbench_repo`); the coordinator only routes to it via this field.

### `track_ref` lifecycle

**`track_ref` lifecycle.** Register against `origin/main` by default. Pin to a workbranch (e.g. `origin/work/<machine>/<date>`) only during active rollout, and flip back to `origin/main` at merge — otherwise the drift probe goes silent (when the workbranch is deleted post-merge) or errors. Plugin authors with separate-checkout-style live installs (project-rag, project-rag-ue-addon, future plugins) should set this field as part of registration; the drift probe (`check-plugin-drift.py`) reads it.

### Idempotent registration

`/coordinator:install` Phase 3 Step 5 writes the `[plugin.mirrors.coordinator-claude]` entry to `registry.local.toml` on first run. Re-running `/setup` is idempotent — it checks for the section header before appending. Values set here follow the `registry.local.toml` gitignore convention (§9): the structural shape is declared in `registry.toml`; the machine-specific `live_path` goes in `registry.local.toml`.

### TOML flat-key table-scoping gotcha

Flat keys appended *after* a `[table]` header are scoped to that table, not the document root. `tomllib.loads()` (what the `machine-local` reader uses) scopes them correctly — so a key written after `[plugin.mirrors.coordinator-claude]` resolves as `plugin.mirrors.coordinator-claude."unreal.install_root"`, NOT as a top-level `unreal.install_root`. A naïve append to the end of the file lands the key inside whatever table happens to be last.

**Insert flat quoted keys BEFORE the first `[table]` header** (e.g. via a `_first_table_header_line()` helper); `[header]`-shaped blocks like `[provenance.unreal]` go at the end since they open their own table. **Verify by reader lookup, not text-search:** `machine-local get unreal.install_root` confirms the key resolves at the intended scope — a text-grep of the file passes even when the reader lookup fails because the key is mis-scoped.

## Verifying Registry Health

These are the coordinator-doctor.md §3 probes P-1 through P-4. Paste them in a shell for a quick sanity check; consult [`coordinator-doctor.md`](coordinator-doctor.md) for the full structured diagnostic experience (including remediation steps for each failure mode).

```bash
# Quick verify (paste in shell):
test -d "$(machine-local dir)"                          # P-1 — settings-home machine-local exists
machine-local has schema                                # P-4 — reader works + schema declared
machine-local get repos.project_rag                     # P-3 — sample working-repo key resolves
```

**Settings-home path form:** `machine-local dir` resolves the current settings-home `machine-local/` directory (§4e). Probe by that form, never by a `~/.claude/bin/machine-local` absolute path — no installer path writes `~/.claude/bin/`, so on a fresh install that file does not exist and a probe pinned to it reports a broken registry that is in fact healthy.

Note: `repos.coordinator_claude` is not a `repos.*` key — the equivalent path lives at `publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude.path`. The sample probe above uses `repos.project_rag` as a stable working-repo key. See `coordinator-doctor.md` for the full probe narrative and current remediation steps.

Bare `machine-local …` invocation works on POSIX because a forwarder shim ships in the harness-injected coordinator bin for both `machine-local` and `claude-home` (pre-migration path: `plugins/coordinator/bin/{machine-local,claude-home}`; the forwarders now live in claude-klabauter's `coordinator/bin/`, commit b644d5a9) — see `docs/plans/2026-06-18-machine-local-bare-invocation-macos.md`.
<!-- review: code-reviewer slice2-F3 — extended to name both resolvers; workstream shipped forwarders for machine-local AND claude-home -->

If any probe fails, coordinator-doctor.md §3 has the remediation steps.

## Untracking a machine-specific value from a shared tracked file — multi-consumer + co-writer sweep

Moving a machine-specific value OUT of a shared tracked file and INTO the `.local` layer (or a per-machine registry key) is not a one-line edit — it is a **multi-consumer + co-writer sweep**. Before the move:

1. **Grep all readers** of the value across every consumer (tools, scripts, hooks, sibling repos) — each must resolve from the new location or carry a fallback.
2. **Grep all writers / co-writers** — any installer, daemon, or ceremony that *writes* the old location must be repointed too, or it silently re-introduces the machine-specific value into the tracked file on its next run.
3. **Check install order for clobber** — if a later install step rewrites the tracked file, the untrack is undone; sequence the writers so the `.local` move is durable.
4. **Merging-reader transparency** — a reader that merges the tracked baseline with `.local` overrides must surface which layer won, so a stale tracked value can't silently shadow the per-machine one.

(Source: project-rag.) Composes with §9 (tracked baseline + `.local` overrides) and `install-surface-completeness.md § settings.json portability` (the same tracked-union + local-override shape for harness-managed config).

**Peer-pull propagation — the sweep above is single-machine; a synced meta-repo has a second
direction.** `git rm --cached` on a machine-specific value stages a **deletion**, and a peer
machine's next `git merge` applies that deletion to its own working tree — which re-arms whatever
the tracked value was suppressing there, not just stops future syncing of it. Concretely:
`~/.claude/.coordinator-hooks-disabled` (a per-machine kill-switch for coordinator hook generation,
armed against the Windows spawn tax) untracked on one machine can have its deletion land
on a second machine via merge, silently re-enabling hook generation there and corrupting
`settings.json` with paths baked for the wrong machine. Full incident and the guard-inertness
pattern it also surfaced: `docs/wiki/tracked-machine-local-corruption-incident.md`. Before
untracking a value out of a *synced* tracked file (not just a locally-cloned one), confirm every
peer machine already has an independent, correctly-scoped source for that value BEFORE the untrack
lands — the peer's merge will apply your deletion whether or not their side is ready for it.

## Browser-spawned interpreter runtimes — embed `sys.executable`, not a bare name

**Browser-spawned interpreted runtimes (Chrome/Chromium native-messaging hosts, and any browser-launched interpreter) must embed `sys.executable` in the launcher — the browser strips PATH, so a `python3`-on-PATH shim silently fails to launch.**

The native-host manifest's `path` field (the launch command) must be an absolute interpreter path captured via `sys.executable` at install time. A bare `python3` that resolves correctly in a normal shell session resolves to nothing inside a browser-spawned child because browsers do not inherit the user's shell PATH. Apply to any process launched by a browser extension or native-messaging registration; the rule is not Chrome-specific — any sandboxed launcher that strips PATH has the same shape.

How to apply: at install time, write the manifest's interpreter field as `sys.executable` (Python), the `node` binary resolved via an absolute `which`/`command -v` probe, or the result of `shutil.which` filtered for WindowsApps stubs (see § Python resolver above). Never hard-code `/usr/bin/python3` (absent on many macOS), `python3` (PATH-relative, fails in stripped env), or `python` (absent on modern Linux/macOS). Validate post-install by launching the host directly from its registered manifest path, not from your shell.

*Empirical origin: example-league-data-repo — native-messaging host manifest used bare `python3`; Chrome spawned it with a stripped PATH, process failed to start silently. Same class as the python3-on-Windows WindowsApps-stub failure (§ Python resolver); the fix shape is identical: absolute path captured at install time.*

## 13. Regeneratability Classification

<!-- spec-backlink: archive/specs/2026-06/2026-06-22-invariant-verification-observers.md § C1 (Flag 3) -->

Every coordinator-owned registry key is classified by its **regeneratability** — the answer to: *if this value is lost (e.g., a fresh-machine clone, a crash, or a gitignored file not restored), can it be recovered without losing work?*

### Three-value enum

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `idempotent-regeneratable` | The value can be re-derived by running an idempotent script or installer step with no human input and no state loss. Example: `coordinator.python` is repaired by `coordinator_core.install.ensure_venv` when unset or unhealthy. |
| `session-accumulated-must-survive-crash` | The value is set by the operator or an install step and cannot be regenerated from code alone — it encodes the operator's machine layout. Loss requires the operator to re-enter the path manually on each machine. |
| `ephemeral` | The value is transient or can be ignored on loss; it is not needed for correct operation after a restart. |

### Canonical home — `[regeneratability]` TOML table

Classification lives in a real `[regeneratability]` TOML section in `registry.toml` (tracked). This is the **machine-readable form** consumed by `bin/check-machine-local-regeneratability.py`. Do NOT use inline `# regeneratability:` comments — `tomllib` discards comments on load and they cannot be surfaced by the `machine-local` CLI.

```toml
[regeneratability]
"coordinator.python"       = "idempotent-regeneratable"
"repos.project_rag"        = "idempotent-regeneratable"
"publish.targets"          = "ephemeral"
```
<!-- Review: code-reviewer Slice-C — F1: repos.* reclassified to idempotent-regeneratable (rung-2 autodiscovery); F2: publish.targets reconciled to ephemeral to match registry.toml:172-173. -->

See `templates/machine-local/registry.toml.example` § `[regeneratability]` for the full classification table with all coordinator-owned keys.

### Classification of all coordinator-owned keys

| Key | Regeneratability | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `coordinator.python` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Repaired by `coordinator_core.install.ensure_venv` when unset or unhealthy — regeneration yields *a* working interpreter, not necessarily the one the operator had chosen, so a deliberate non-default choice is worth recording elsewhere. A healthy value is left alone. See §5c. |
| `plugin.mirrors.*` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Mirror registrations are written by each plugin's installer; re-running the installer restores them. |
| `publish.targets` | `ephemeral` | Absent until explicitly configured; falls through to `setup/publish-targets.portable` when unset. Publish DEST roots resolve via `publish.mirrors.*.path`, not `repos.*`. |
| `publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude.path` | `session-accumulated-must-survive-crash` | Per-machine path set by the operator; no installer re-derives it. Resolves the coordinator-claude publish DEST root for the portable topology. Provision: `machine-local set publish.mirrors.coordinator_claude.path /abs/path`. |
| `publish.mirrors.deep_research_claude.path` | `session-accumulated-must-survive-crash` | Per-machine path set by the operator; no installer re-derives it. Resolves the deep-research-claude publish DEST root for the portable topology. Provision: `machine-local set publish.mirrors.deep_research_claude.path /abs/path`. |
| `repos.example-sim-repo` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.project_rag` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.project_rag_ue_addon` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.example_game_workbench_repo` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.example_repo` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.example_stats_repo` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.example_league_data_repo` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.experiments` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.example_cockpit_repo` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.example-os-repo` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Derived at runtime by rung-2 marker autodiscovery via `search-roots.toml` for convention-installed repos; rung-4 `registry.local.toml` is the fallback for off-convention repos. |
| `repos.claude_klabauter` | **`session-accumulated-must-survive-crash`** — NOT rung-2-autodiscoverable | `claude-klabauter` is an engine repo, not a Claude Code plugin — it carries no `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` marker at either scanned location (`<root>/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` or `<root>/plugin/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), so the rung-2 scanner (`_scan_marker` in `templates/bin/_machine_local.py`) can never resolve it. The AUTHORITATIVE writer is `claude-klabauter`'s own standalone installer — `scripts/setup.py::register_claude_klabauter_root()` (claude-klabauter repo, the `standalone_setup_script.posix`/`.windows` target in `docs/install/agent-install-manifest.json`) — which is cross-platform naked Python but is **never invoked by DoE-claude's own install path** (`coordinator/commands/install.md`, `coordinator/scripts/install-maximalist.py`). A second, weaker writer exists and must not be mistaken for a guarantee: `coordinator_core/install/first_run.py` seeds `repos.<slug>` keys generically by discovering working repos and deriving the slug from the directory basename, so it *can* land this key — but it is opt-out-interactive (declining the prompt skips seeding entirely), best-effort (failures warn and continue under a never-block contract), and reached via a separate `coordinator/scripts/first-run` entrypoint rather than the maximalist install chain. Neither install-order (claude-klabauter-first or coordinator-first) writes the key automatically: claude-klabauter-first skips registration (advisory, exit 0) because `machine-local` isn't yet on PATH; coordinator-first never chains claude-klabauter's registration step at all. The operator (or an install orchestrator, on either OS) must explicitly run `claude-klabauter`'s `python3 scripts/setup.py` *after* both repos are present AND coordinator-claude's `machine-local` CLI resolves, or hand-run `machine-local set repos.claude_klabauter <path>` (rung 4). Every consumer (`cc_invoke.py`, `coordinator_core/claude_klabauter_root.py`, `queue_promote.py`, `queue_append.py`, coordinator's own `scripts/setup.py --preflight`, `gen-claude-klabauter-root-pointer.py`, `bin/claude-klabauter-doctor-probe.py`) fails loud with this exact remediation string when the key is unresolvable — the gap is a missing install-time write, not a silent failure. |
| `repos.claude_klabauter` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | The published coordinator-engine mirror root, distinct from `repos.claude_klabauter` (the engine-source working tree) and from `engine.working_repos.*` (§5c.3, the discriminant for repos that *develop* the engine). Written at install time by the mirror's own installer, `scripts/setup.py::register_claude_klabauter_root()` (commit `5080edc48d3f`), when `resolve_repo_identity()` determines the current checkout is a published claude-klabauter mirror rather than the engine-source tree — a `claude-klabauter` install writes neither this key nor a ref/sha alongside it. No ref/sha field is stored, deliberately (a stored value nothing compares against gets trusted eventually); the sha is read live via `git rev-parse` when one is needed. Consumer: `coordinator/hooks/scripts/_engine_root.py::_resolve_published_engine()`, which also requires `(<root>/coordinator_core).is_dir()` before trusting the registered root — the half-installed-clone guard. |
| `engine.working_repos.*` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Each key self-heals from its own repo's own installer, distinct from `repos.*`'s rung-2 autodiscovery (§ below): `engine.working_repos.claude_klabauter` is written by `claude-klabauter`'s `scripts/setup.py::register_claude_klabauter_root()`; `engine.working_repos.doe_claude` is written by `coordinator/hooks/scripts/session-start-register-doe-claude-root.py`, a SessionStart hook (`async: true`) that idempotently re-derives and, if needed, rewrites the key every session from this repo's own `__file__`-resolved root, guarded by the repo-root `.coordinator-dev-repo` sentinel so it can never register a consumer repo's tree. See §5c.3 and DR-132. |
| `test.xdist_workers` | `idempotent-regeneratable` | Fast-tier pytest-xdist worker cap; computed count passed as `-n <N>` at invocation. Default formula: `max(1, floor(cores*0.5))`. Per-repo convention key — no coordinator infrastructure writes this; repos read it at invocation to cap parallelism on shared concurrent-EM boxes. → `docs/wiki/test-design-discipline.md § Posture: Proportional Test-Running`. |

### `repos.*` regeneratability — common case vs. rung-4 fallback

`repos.*` working-repo paths are `idempotent-regeneratable` for convention-installed repos: rung-2 marker autodiscovery derives the path at runtime from `search-roots.toml` — no absolute path stored in `registry.local.toml`. Off-convention repos that are not discoverable under any search-root or path-exception fall through to the rung-4 `registry.local.toml` fallback (`session-accumulated-must-survive-crash`), requiring manual `machine-local set repos.<slug>` entry per machine. `publish.mirrors.*.path` mirror values are always `session-accumulated-must-survive-crash` — there is no autodiscovery mechanism for publish-target DEST roots. They live in `registry.local.toml` (gitignored per §9).

**The 4-rung ladder (§4c, SSOT: `project-rag/docs/wiki/cross-machine-path-resolution-contract.md`) closes the common-case Bootstrap gap for convention-installed repos.** Rung 2 (marker autodiscovery) derives `repos.<slug>` at runtime from the tracked `search-roots.toml` and the repo's `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` identity marker — no absolute path is stored in `registry.local.toml`. A fresh-machine clone of `~/.claude` with a correctly configured `search-roots.toml` resolves all convention-installed repos through rung 2 without any manual `machine-local set` invocation.

Manual `machine-local set repos.<slug> /abs/path` (rung 4) is the last-resort fallback for repos that are genuinely off-convention (not discoverable under any `search-roots.toml` entry) and also absent from the tracked exceptions table (`path-exceptions.toml`, rung 3). This is the uncommon case, not the default.

**`repos.claude_klabauter` is a standing rung-4 case, not a transitional one.** It is a non-plugin engine repo with no `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` marker, so rung 2 structurally cannot resolve it on any machine, ever — it is not "off-convention today, fixable by adding a marker" but off-convention by what the repo *is*. See its dedicated row in § Classification of all coordinator-owned keys above for the writer and the current install-order gap.

For publish mirror paths, `machine-local set publish.mirrors.<key>.path /abs/path` remains a manual step — there is no autodiscovery mechanism for publish-target DEST roots.

The Bootstrap gap for *off-convention repos* (those requiring an operator-supplied absolute rung-4 path) remains open. A generative installer that interactively configures `search-roots.toml` for new operators is the longer-term fix — tracked in `docs/wiki/install-surface-completeness.md` § Bootstrap gap.

The regeneratability check (`bin/check-machine-local-regeneratability.py`, Step 2.95 sub-check) flags `session-accumulated-must-survive-crash` keys without a tracked baseline declaration. The remediation it offers:

```bash
machine-local set --global "<key>" ""   # adds tracked baseline declaration
# then document the manual population step in your machine's setup notes
```

## 14. New-machine landing sequence

When `~/.claude` is git-cloned onto a fresh machine, the machine-local substrate does not exist, the coordinator venv is absent, and per-machine state (`settings.local.json`, `known_marketplaces.json`, `registry.local.toml`, `.coordinator-venv/`) has not been regenerated. This section documents the end-to-end landing sequence.

### Step 1 — Clone

```bash
git clone <your-~/.claude-remote> ~/.claude
```

Nothing else exists yet. The machine-local registry directory, the coordinator venv, and all gitignored per-machine files are absent by design (§9).

### Step 2 — Run `coordinator/scripts/first-run`

```bash
python3 coordinator/scripts/first-run          # interactive, preview-then-confirm
python3 coordinator/scripts/first-run --plan   # dry-run: print what would happen, no mutation
```

On Windows, prefer the `.cmd` sibling directly rather than routing through a shell — it avoids the Microsoft Store `python3` alias-stub gotcha (see `install-surface-completeness.md § Running-in-Claude-Code`):

```cmd
coordinator\scripts\first-run.cmd
coordinator\scripts\first-run.cmd --plan
```

`coordinator/scripts/first-run` is the **plugin-independent first-run entrypoint** that solves the bootstrap paradox: `/coordinator:install` is itself an unregistered plugin on a fresh clone — it cannot load before the coordinator plugin is registered. Similarly, the predecessor bash setup entrypoint hard-exits on bash < 4 and stock macOS ships bash 3.2. `coordinator/scripts/first-run` is the naked-Python trampoline (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`, with a `.cmd` sibling for Windows) that supersedes the bash oracle `coordinator/scripts/first-run.sh`; the bash original is gone from this tree (`git ls-files` confirms). The Python trampoline needs no bash-3.2 parse-safety discipline and no self-re-exec-under-bash≥4.3 dance — it runs directly as Python, invoked from wherever the coordinator plugin source lives on this machine (the DoE-claude source checkout on dev machines; the OSS `coordinator-claude` clone for OSS installs) rather than through a repo-root `bin/first-run.sh` wrapper, which does not exist.

**What first-run does:**

1. **Toolchain detection.** Probes for bash ≥ 4.3, Homebrew, Python, Node, uv, and git-lfs. Reports gaps.
2. **Preview-then-confirm.** Prints a summary of what it will install; the operator confirms before any mutation. `--plan` exits at this point.
3. **Homebrew + bash ≥ 4.3.** Offers to install Homebrew if absent; installs bash ≥ 4.3 via Homebrew on macOS. Re-execs itself under the newly installed bash so the rest of the script runs with bash-4 features available.
4. **Python, Node, uv, git-lfs.** Offers each missing toolchain component; installs on confirmation.
5. **Machine-local registry seed.** Creates `machine-local/` and seeds it with `registry.toml` defaults so the `machine-local` CLI works.
6. **Per-machine state regeneration.** Runs in order:
   - `lib/install-substrate.py` — lays down `machine-local/`, installs `bin/` resolver shims (`machine-local`, `claude-home`), and (via `coordinator_core.install.ensure_venv`, claude-klabauter-resident) creates the coordinator venv at `~/.claude/.coordinator-venv/` and writes the `coordinator.python` registry key (§5c).
   - `bin/platform-localize.py` — generates platform-specific state (`settings.local.json`, `known_marketplaces.json`).
7. **`git lfs install`.** Installs git-lfs hooks into this clone.

After `first-run` completes, the machine-local substrate is populated and all regeneratable state (§13) has been re-derived.

### Step 3 — One `/reload-plugins` in Claude Code (NOT a full restart)

Open Claude Code (or the already-running session) and run:

```
/reload-plugins
```

This activates the freshly-cloned coordinator plugin for the current session. A full Claude Code restart is **not** required for plugin activation alone. There is a one-reload lag that is inherent to Claude Code's plugin lifecycle: a `SessionStart` hook fires when the session opens, before any plugins are registered — it cannot register into the already-running session. `/reload-plugins` is the correct repair, not a workaround.

After the reload, run `/coordinator:install` for the full install sequence (operator-identity capture, MCP wiring, skill registration, etc.).

### Why this regenerates rather than tracks

Per-machine state (`settings.local.json`, `known_marketplaces.json`, `registry.local.toml`, `.coordinator-venv/`) is **gitignored by design** (§9). These files contain machine-specific paths, platform-specific config, and environment-derived values that are wrong on every other machine. The correct fix for new-machine landing is **reliable regeneration on arrival** (the sequence above) plus a **machine-path guard** (values resolved through `machine-local get <key>` rather than hardcoded) — NOT tracking machine state in git. Tracking machine-specific values into git is the §8(f) and §9 anti-pattern; the §13 `session-accumulated-must-survive-crash` classification documents the one class of value (operator-set `repos.*` paths) that genuinely requires manual re-entry per machine.

**PERCOLATION NOTE:** `coordinator/scripts/first-run` (naked Python, with its `.cmd` sibling) ships to the OSS coordinator-claude publish repo via claude-klabauter's `coordinator/bin/publish.py` (resolved via `CLAUDE_KLABAUTER_ROOT`, migrated out of this repo in commit `b644d5a9`; driven by the `/percolate` skill; the shell `publish.sh` predecessor was deleted in the percolate Python port). OSS users hit the same bootstrap paradox on a fresh clone and the same script solves it.

## 15. Operator-Identity Surface Completeness Sweep

<!-- spec-backlink: coordinator/templates/settings-manifest.md § Device-Singular vs. OSS-Canonical Discriminator -->
<!-- PM directive: 2026-07-07 — enumerate all on-device operator-identity surfaces and their disposition -->

This section is a **provably complete enumeration** of on-device operator-identity surfaces and their disposition against the device-singular vs. OSS-canonical discriminator (see `coordinator/templates/settings-manifest.md § Device-Singular vs. OSS-Canonical Discriminator`). Its job is to ensure no operator-identity surface is silently left hardcoded in committed source.

**Discriminator reminder.** Device-singular operator identity (values unique to one operator/device) → `registry.local.toml`, operator-set, fail-loud-on-unset. OSS-canonical project constants (values identical for every operator) → committed source; moving them breaks publish.

| Surface | Current location | Disposition | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| OwnerNamespace GitHub orgs | `owner-namespaces.ts` (deleted; formerly committed source) | **RETIRED — owner is now a validated string; no namespace enum, no registry key.** | `owner` is a validated string (`z.string().min(1)`), not a closed enum, so no namespace-enum seam exists — `owner-namespaces.ts`, `test/owner-seam.test.ts`, and `test/owner-emit-example.sh` are gone. There is no owner-namespace set to configure, so `cockpit.owner_namespaces` does not exist in `machine-local`. |
| Meta-repo slug | `.example-doctrine-mirror-repo` sentinel / `emit-cockpit-snapshot.sh` (hardcoded) | **MOVED → `cockpit.meta_repo_slug`** (this workstream) | Device-singular: the operator's `owner/repo` meta-repo slug differs per operator. Committed source personalized the OSS artifact. Now resolved via `machine-local get cockpit.meta_repo_slug` with cold-safe fail-loud. |
| `COORDINATOR_PUBLISH_OWNER` / `dbc-oduffy/coordinator-claude` publish destination | Committed source | **STAYS in committed source** | OSS-canonical project constant: the canonical publish destination for the coordinator-claude OSS repo is the same for every operator running the official coordinator. Moving it to `registry.local.toml` would break publish for fresh-install operators who haven't set the key. This is NOT device-singular. |
| `working-repos.yaml` (`$ROOT/working-repos.yaml`, consumed by `coordinator/bin/emit-cockpit-snapshot.py`) | On-disk UNTRACKED config file listing the operator's fleet repo slugs | **CANDIDATE for settings-home relocation — FOLLOW-UP** | The fleet-owner identity is DERIVED via slug-split, not hardcoded. The file itself is already untracked, so it does not personalize committed source in the same way as the MOVED surfaces above. However, its placement outside the settings home (`~/.coordinator-claude-settings/`) is inconsistent with the on-device substrate doctrine (§4e). Relocation to `<settings-home>/working-repos.yaml` or representation as a `cockpit.*` registry key is a candidate follow-up, but is NOT this workstream's live case. Listed here so the sweep is provably complete rather than silently partial. |

**Sweep completeness claim.** The four rows above cover all known operator-identity surfaces in the cockpit emission path. Any new surface discovered must be added here in the same commit that reclassifies it — the table is the audit artifact.
