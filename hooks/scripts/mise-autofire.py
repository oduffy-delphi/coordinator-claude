"""UserPromptExpansion auto-fire hook for the wide run's run-id minting
(naked Python, no bash) -- the mise-side twin of `pickup-autofire.py`.

Purpose: when the EM types `/mise-en-place` or `/warp-speed-execute` (the two
verbs naming one ceremony -- see `_MISE_COMMAND_NAMES`), this hook fires
ahead of `UserPromptSubmit`, mints a
fresh Phase-0 run id via the engine plane's `backlog-grind-assemble
mint-run-id mise-en-place` CLI, immediately briefs that same id back through
`backlog-grind-assemble brief mise-en-place --run-id <minted>`, and injects
both the minted id (plus the inventory path it implies, and the brief's
decision object) as `additionalContext` -- so the EM's own turn already has
an engine-issued run id in hand rather than inventing one by convention.

Both calls are READ-ONLY. Unlike `pickup-autofire.py`'s twin surface (which
auto-fires a mutating `apply` half on a clear coast), this hook has NO
mutating half and must never grow one: `mint-run-id` and `brief` are the
entire surface it touches. Phase 6 (the mutating cadence-close step) stays
an EM-driven invocation quoting the minted id, exactly as before this hook
existed -- see the cross-repo memo cited below for the boundary this was
built against.

Co-fires with `pickup-autofire.py`, by design and without conflict: that
hook's `_BATON_GRAB_COMMAND_NAMES` matches the same verbs, because batons
handed to the wide run are a grab too (`skills/pickup/SKILL.md` §
Multi-Artifact Grab). It briefs the baton paths carried in `command_args`;
this one mints the run id the cadence itself needs. Two `additionalContext`
blocks on one prompt is the expected shape, not a double-fire bug -- neither
hook reads or writes what the other computes.

Contract (mirrors `pickup-autofire.py`):
  stdin   -- UserPromptExpansion JSON (command_name, command_args,
             command_source, cwd, expansion_type, session_id, prompt_id, ...)
  stdout  -- one `hookSpecificOutput` JSON envelope with `additionalContext`
             when a mise-en-place verb was matched and a mint+brief pair
             could be computed; NOTHING otherwise (silent pass -- an
             unrelated command, or a total transport failure, produces no
             output)
  exit 0  -- always. This hook is advisory only and never blocks the EM's
             own prompt.

Cross-repo provenance: the engine plane's commit `339470fd6bd7` shipped
`mint-run-id <cadence>` as a sibling subcommand to `brief`/`apply` on the
same `backlog-grind-assemble` trampoline; the consumer contract this hook
relies on is pinned in
`cross-repo/inbox/2026-08-04-claude-klabauter-em-mint-run-id-verb-shipped.md`:

  - `inventory_path` is repo-relative POSIX on every platform, never
    machine-absolute -- it is the path the id IMPLIES, not a path that
    exists yet.
  - The verb is read-only and specifically never creates
    `state/mise-inventory/`. That directory's ABSENCE is the engine's own
    Phase-0-vs-Phase-6 self-gate; this hook must not create it either, not
    as a side effect, not "helpfully" -- there is no filesystem-touching
    code anywhere in this module.
  - A cadence no reader claims is a usage error (exit 2) -- only
    `mise-en-place` claims it today, and `_CADENCE` is that literal on every
    invocation verb this hook matches, so that failure mode is never actually
    reachable from here; it still degrades to silent pass per this module's
    fail-open discipline rather than assuming the exit code.
  - A minted id is by construction accepted by the very next
    `brief mise-en-place --run-id <minted>` -- confirmed live at authoring
    time; the brief call is not expected to reject its own freshly-minted
    input, but its failure still degrades to silent pass like every other
    step.

Safety envelope, each clause load-bearing:
  (a) NEVER fires a mutating call. There is no `apply`-equivalent anywhere
      in this module; `mint-run-id` and `brief` are both read-only per the
      memo above, and that is the whole surface this hook touches.
  (b) Hook errors / timeouts / transport failures degrade to silent pass and
      NEVER block the run's prompt -- every subprocess call and every JSON
      decode in this module is wrapped to fail open, and `main()` never
      raises. A failed mint means the EM mints by hand, exactly today's
      behaviour.
  (c) `additionalContext` never exceeds `_CONTEXT_BUDGET_CHARS` (10,000).
      Over budget, the rendered text is hard-truncated as a last resort --
      this hook's payload is small and fixed-shape (an id, a path, one
      decision object), so no priority-ladder degrade is needed the way
      `pickup-autofire.py`'s N-baton render requires.
  (d) `async: false` semantics: the minted id and briefed decision must land
      in the SAME turn the EM's prompt is being expanded into -- an async
      fire would compute the mint after the EM has already acted on the
      prompt, which defeats the purpose entirely.
