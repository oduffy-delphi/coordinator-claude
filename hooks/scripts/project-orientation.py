"""SessionStart hook: inject project orientation documents into context.

Naked-Python direct port of the former bash SessionStart hook, per the W4a-sessionstart
port recipe (scratch/subagent-sandbox/bash-to-python-migration/
W4a-sessionstart-recipe.md § 2.2). Convention-based discovery — reads what
exists, skips what doesn't.

Disposition (recipe § 2.2): naked-Python direct port. **No claude-klabauter op is
authored or called by this hook** — the boot-time `session.boot_sweep` /
`session.reap` claude-klabauter ops are NOT invoked here (this hook's zero-subprocess
boot mandate below forbids a cc_invoke claude-klabauter spawn on the boot path). Those
ops were historically driven by the separate `session-init.py` SessionStart
hook (deleted in the 2026-07-15 full-kill); `session.boot_sweep` is now
carried by its own async `bin/sweep-boot.py` SessionStart hook
(`hooks/hooks.json`, matcher `startup|compact`), whose archival side effect
imposes zero first-token latency because async SessionStart stdout is
discarded rather than injected. The bash predecessor of this hook never routed
through a claude-klabauter op on disk (confirmed:
no `session.orientation`-shaped op exists in `coordinator_core/ops/` on either
repo as of this port). Its only nexus to claude-klabauter at all is the rare case where
the current repo IS the coordinator meta-repo (`~/.claude`) — state-root then
redirects to claude-klabauter's `state/` dir, resolved via the fast local `.claude-klabauter-root`
pointer-FILE read only (AC8, recipe § 4), mirroring `session-init.py`'s
`_resolve_claude_klabauter_root_fast()` shape and `preuse-write-dispatch.py`'s
`_resolve_claude_klabauter_root()` "no bash, no probe chain" philosophy — no
env/registry/marker ladder, no subprocess re-spawn. The common case (any
sibling repo, e.g. this repo itself) never touches the engine repo at all: state root
is a direct `<repo_root>/state` join, zero subprocess.

AC8 boot-race hook (recipe § 4): this hook and `session-init.py` are the ONLY
two SessionStart hooks whose stdout composes the FIRST-boot `additionalContext`
(`SessionStart:startup`, sync, per `hooks.json`). Latency here is boot latency.

Flags:
  --lightweight   THE production boot path — the SessionStart hook
                   registration in hooks.json always passes this flag; no
                   other caller exists (repo-wide grep, 2026-07-15). Skips
                   heavy operations (scc, git log, full-mode pointer docs)
                   AND, as of the 2026-07-15 PM directive below, skips ALL
                   subprocess spawns (git AND bash) on the common
                   cache-present path.

Boot fast-path, ZERO subprocess (PM directive 2026-07-15, tightened same
day): every subprocess spawn costs ~200-500ms on Windows, and this hook's
stdout gates first-token-to-context on every SessionStart (AC8 below) — so
the `--lightweight` boot path must reach zero process spawns of any kind on
its common (cache-present) branch. Concretely, relative to the pre-2026-07-15
port, THREE things moved off the boot path:
  1. `resolve_repo_root()`'s `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` → replaced by
     `resolve_repo_root_boot()` (env var `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, else a pure-
     Python upward walk for a `.git` marker).
  2. `handle_cache_present()`'s staleness banner — `git cat-file -t
     <cache_head>`, a `git diff --quiet <cache_head>..HEAD -- <pathspecs>`,
     and on a stale hit a second `git diff --name-only` — replaced by
     `handle_cache_present_boot()`, a pure read-and-echo of
     `orientation_cache.md` with no staleness check at all. Staleness
     detection is deferred to `/workday-start`, which unconditionally
     regenerates the cache each morning (stronger than a stale-banner: the
     cache becomes FRESH, not just flagged).
  3. `resolve_state_root()`'s rare meta-repo (`~/.claude`) fail-safe
     bash spawn into the former shell `coordinator-state-root` resolver
     (now `claude-klabauter coordinator/lib/coordinator-state-root.py`) — skipped on
     `boot=True` (see that function's docstring); non-boot callers keep it.
  4. `lightweight_branch()`'s cache-ABSENT fallback banner also dropped its
     `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` call, reading `.git/HEAD` directly
     instead (`_read_current_branch_boot()`) — this branch is rare (fires
     only when no orientation cache exists yet) but still reachable on the
     `--lightweight` boot invocation, so it's in scope for the same
     zero-spawn mandate.
The two stat()-based staleness banners (`repomap_staleness_banner`,
`exec_summary_staleness_banner`) were ALREADY zero-subprocess (`Path.stat()`
mtime + `shutil.which`, no git/bash) and are kept as-is — near-free, and
dropping them would lose the repomap/exec-summary freshness nudge for no
boot-latency benefit.

Ordering (bash-oracle parity, restored per B-F4 review finding, adapted for
the boot fast-path above): the two staleness banners are emitted first
(matches the oracle — they run on every session path, cache present or
not), then the cache-present check, THEN the --lightweight gate as a
fallback only when no cache exists. An earlier draft of this port checked
--lightweight before opening/diffing the cache file, which meant
`--lightweight` fired even when a warm `orientation_cache.md` was present —
diverging from the oracle, whose cache-present block ALWAYS short-circuited
before reaching the lightweight check. That divergence has been removed;
see `lightweight_branch()`'s docstring for detail. The full-mode
(non-`--lightweight`) legacy path in `main()` is UNCHANGED — it still uses
`resolve_repo_root()`/`handle_cache_present()`'s git-verified staleness
banner; there is currently no production caller of that path (see Flags
above), but it is retained for direct/manual/debug invocation.

Windows stdout byte-parity (B-F3 review finding): every banner line is
written via `sys.stdout.buffer.write(text.encode("utf-8"))`, never
`print()`/`sys.stdout.write()` — Windows text-mode stdout silently rewrites
LF to CRLF, which would diverge byte-for-byte from the bash oracle's
LF-only output (golden-diff acceptance criterion). Mirrors the convention
in `ue-knowledge-distrust.py` (~142-147).

Contract: SessionStart hooks MUST exit 0 unconditionally (harness contract).
Any resolution/import error along non-essential paths degrades gracefully
(skips that section) rather than raising.

# than inventing a second staleness convention (that plan's Anti-scope) -- both banners read a
# `ran_at`-bearing sentinel and both are daily-cadence artifacts, so one concern-neutral constant
# is correct, not coincidental reuse. `docs/wiki/addon-health-sentinel.md`: "stale sentinels
# (>24h since ran_at)". P-19 refreshes daily under `/workday-start` Step 1.10, so a cache within
# this window reflects that day's run.

def install_currency_banner(repo_root: Optional[str]) -> None:
    """Print the plugin install-currency verdict, read from the cached P-19 sentinel only.

    Reads `~/.claude/plugins/coordinator-claude/data/doctor-last-run.json` (`_claude_home()`-
    relative, so this resolves the same install root `local_install_surface_banner` and
    `harness_version_drift_banner` already read) at most ONCE per invocation and reuses the
    parsed object for every branch below — no second open, no second `json.loads`, matching this
    hook's file-read-count-must-not-grow contract (plan C2 body). Zero subprocess: a single
    `Path.read_text()` plus `json.loads`, nothing else — this hook's standing boot-path mandate
    (module docstring) binds here exactly as it does every other banner in this file.

    **Interim consumer-side contract (plan C2; not the final shape — see below):**
    `doctor-last-run.json` has no machine-readable per-probe verdict field
    (`P19-SILENT-TRIBRANCH`, `docs/wiki/coordinator-tripwires/tripwire-registry/
    boot-currency-notification-throttle-invariant-boot-currency-throttle.md`). P-19's verdict
    survives only as one rendered English sentence inside `advisory_notes`, addressable by its
    `P-19: ` prefix and nothing more structured than that:

      - `advisory_notes` carries a `P-19: `-prefixed entry -> echoed VERBATIM as the rendered
        line. Not re-parsed, not reformatted -- echoing satisfies A1 without parsing prose out of
        a summary string, which the plan (C2 body) forbids outright.
      - the verdict cache is older than `_CURRENCY_BANNER_STALE_HOURS`, or `ran_at`/the file
        itself fails to parse -> rendered as `stale-unknown`, in those words, naming how old the
        cache is (or that it is unparseable) and that `/workday-start` refreshes it. NEVER
        rendered as `current` and NEVER rendered as `behind` -- a stale or missing verdict
        pretending to be either reproduces the exact defect this plan exists to close, or trains
        the operator to ignore the line (plan Anti-scope).
      - no cache file at all -> rendered as absent, in those words, naming what populates it.
      - `advisory_notes` has no `P-19: ` line (the fresh-cache, no-entry case) -> this is NOT
        distinguishable from `current`, `offline`, or `source_is_live` from this artifact alone,
        all three leave `advisory_notes` empty for P-19. Render NOTHING for the plugin surface in
        this branch.

    **A3 and A6 are NOT met by this interim shape**, and that is a deliberate, named gap rather
    than an oversight. A3 (a stale-unknown verdict must never render as `current`) is honoured for
    the *cache-freshness* axis -- an old or unparseable cache always renders `stale-unknown` -- but
    a *fresh* cache with no `P-19: ` line is rendered as silence, and that silence is genuinely
    ambiguous across `current`, `offline`, and `source_is_live`: it is not a verified `current`,
    only an unverifiable one. A6 (an honest verdict per topology, specifically the `offline` case)
    is not met either -- `offline` renders identically to `current`/`source_is_live` here, so a
    consumer-install machine that has lost network access to the publish repo gets the same
    silence as one that is fully current. Closing both requires the engine plane to emit a
    structured per-probe verdict token into `doctor-last-run.json` (or a sibling artifact) and to
    emit something non-empty on `offline` -- a producer-side schema change on the probe's own
    surface, not buildable from this consumer artifact (plan AC table note on A3/A6). C7 is the
    follow-through once that emission change lands; this function's `advisory_notes`-echo path is
    the thing C7 replaces, not a permanent design.

    **Why unknown IS rendered here, when `local_install_surface_banner` skips unknowns
    SILENTLY.** The two banners look alike (env-gated, read-only, three-way outcome) but differ in
    what an unevaluable read *means*. There, an unresolvable probe (unknown `kind`, malformed
    manifest, missing target file) is most often a DECLARATION bug in the manifest or a probe
    shape this banner doesn't implement yet -- the surface it is asking about may genuinely be
    present on this machine, and a false "you are missing X" trains the operator to ignore the
    line (that banner's own docstring). Here, a missing or stale verdict means the daily
    `/workday-start` refresh that is supposed to keep this cache honest is NOT RUNNING -- that
    absence IS the failure this banner exists to report, not a side effect of an unrelated
    declaration bug. Silencing it would hide the exact condition (a broken daily refresh) that
    makes every other read of this cache untrustworthy. A later reader must not "harmonize" these
    two banners into one shared unknown-handling rule -- the plan (C2 body, and the boot-banner
    plan's Related-plan note) requires this divergence to stay visible and explained, not collapsed.

    `source_is_live` silences only the PLUGIN surface covered by this function -- it must never be
    read as silencing the engine-currency surface (§ Engine anchor — open contract,
    `docs/wiki/release-cadence-and-currency-notification.md`), which is a distinct, not-yet-built
    axis this function does not touch.

    `COORDINATOR_CURRENCY_STATUS_OFF` kill-switch as `install_currency_banner`/
    `tier_currency_banner` above.

    **Absent vs. stale is a deliberate divergence, not one to "harmonize."** This mirrors the
    exact argument `install_currency_banner` makes above for its own sentinel, and for the same
    reason: absent and stale look alike (both mean "nothing useful to show") but mean opposite
    things. No sentinel at all means this repo has never had a landed `.project-rag-corpus-store/`
    for the probe to walk — most repos never consume a corpus, and warning about an absence that
    is the normal case everywhere would train the operator to ignore the line (the exact defect
    `local_install_surface_banner`'s docstring names). A STALE sentinel means the daily
    `/workday-start` refresh that keeps this cache honest has stopped running — that absence of a
    fresh read IS the failure this banner exists to report, not a side effect of "no corpus here."
    Collapsing the two into one silent (or one loud) branch would either hide a broken daily
    refresh behind the same silence every corpus-free repo already gets, or spam every corpus-free
    repo with a warning about a refresh cadence that was never applicable. They stay visibly
    distinct here on purpose.

    Four-way render:
      - no sentinel file at all -> silent, nothing rendered.
      - sentinel unparseable, top-level JSON not a mapping, `ran_at` missing/unparseable, or the
        sentinel is older than `_CURRENCY_BANNER_STALE_HOURS` -> `stale-unknown`, naming how old
        the cache is (or that it is unparseable) and that `/workday-start` refreshes it. NEVER
        rendered as current, NEVER rendered as behind.
      - `bands` present but not a list -> also `stale-unknown`, naming the malformation. This is
        corruption, not "no bands" -- it must not share a branch with a legitimately-absent or
        empty `bands` list (same distinction `install_currency_banner` draws for a malformed
        `advisory_notes`).
      - fresh sentinel, every band's `verdict` is anything other than `behind`
        (`current`/`undeclared`/`unreachable`) -> silent, nothing rendered; every one of those is
        a clean state from this banner's perspective.
      - fresh sentinel, one or more bands read `verdict: behind` -> one line per behind band,
        naming the band and echoing its `remount_command` VERBATIM -- never reformatted or
        re-derived. C1 built that string against `download_corpus.py`'s real CLI flags precisely
        so it can be pasted as-is; re-deriving it here is how it silently rots out of sync with
        the producer.

    `_ceremony_entries` (C1's parser, reused rather than duplicated). Neither grows with the
    number of declared entries.

    Three-way render per declared entry (AC2, AC3):
      - recorded and `ran_at` within `_CURRENCY_BANNER_STALE_HOURS` -> the entry name and its
        age, e.g. `hook-tests: last ran 6h ago`.
      - recorded but older than the threshold, or `ran_at` unparseable -> `stale`, naming the age
        or that the timestamp is unparseable. Never rendered as current.
      - the entry has no key in the sentinel at all, OR the sentinel file itself is missing or
        unparseable -> the literal word `unknown`, naming that no run has been recorded and
        which command records one. NEVER `current`, NEVER green, NEVER silent.

    Per-entry absence is load-bearing (plan C2 body): a declared entry with no key in the
    sentinel renders `unknown` on its own line beside an already-fresh sibling — the loop below
    is over DECLARED entries, not over the sentinel's own keys, so a second tier entry can never
    silently inherit the first one's freshness by simply not being mentioned.

    NEGATIVE SPEC — a collapsed denominator is never silent. Two outcomes look alike from here
    and must not render alike: "this repo declares no ceremony tier" (no `coordinator.local.md`,
    no `ceremony_test_cmds` key, or an explicit `[]`) is a real answer and renders nothing; but a
    doctrine file that EXISTS and cannot be parsed, or a `tier-last-run.py` that will not import,
    resolves the entry roster to zero for a reason that is a defect, and that renders loudly on
    stderr. Silence there would make this banner tell the exact lie it exists to prevent — the
    same shape as its own `unknown` case, one level up: zero declared entries because we could
    not look is not zero declared entries. The earlier version of this function failed open on
    both, reasoning that a broken doctrine file is "another surface's job to diagnose"; that is
    the rationalisation, not an exception. Corpus-backed checks assert their corpus resolved

    """One line naming WHICH engine this session's hooks will execute.

    DR-129: consumer engine resolution answers "which engine do I execute",
    and until this banner existed the answer was invisible — a consumer running
    a half-edited engine saw a guard behaving oddly, indistinguishable from
    that guard behaving correctly. Two days were lost to exactly that on a
    sibling plane. The `live-working-tree` line is the one that pays for
    itself: a live tree is a legitimate answer on a co-development machine,
    but it must be a visible state rather than an invisible default.

    Zero-spawn (this hook's 2026-07-15 boot mandate): delegates to
    `_engine_root.resolve_claude_klabauter_root_with_class`, which is a stat plus at most
    one small file read. Fail-open: any failure emits nothing.

    `unresolved` deliberately says nothing — a machine with no engine at all is
    the pre-existing silent degrade everywhere else in this file, and inventing
    a new boot-time failure mode for it is not this banner's job.

    Negative-spec — the class comes from the resolver, never re-derived here.
    The snapshot's `sha` is deliberately NOT named on this line: the resolver's
    public seam returns `(root, class)`, and re-reading `current.json` here to
    enrich the banner would put a second read on the boot path and a second
    copy of the pointer contract in a consumer. Which CLASS answered is the
    signal DR-129 asked for; which sha is a question for a surface that already
    parses the pointer.

    Publish-mirror roster leg (2026-08-08; re-cut 2026-08-30 per DR-188
    Option D, chunk C3): after the class line, one line is emitted per
    registered `publish.mirrors.*` entry naming it as NOT a peer repo — but
    no longer unconditionally. Each roster row now passes a per-mirror gate,
    distinct from the plane predicate below: a row prints if and only if it
    is either THIS session's resolved engine root (`_root`, above — in which
    case its fact folds into the class line instead, see below) or a
    declared publish target of this repo's OWN topology
    (`resolve_own_publish_target_keys()`, reading `setup/publish-
    targets.portable`). A mirror that is neither is foreign identity to this
    session and is dropped entirely — this is what closes the exit criterion
    a bare `klass`-unconditional or plane-only gate could not: "every path
    shown is either this session's own resolved engine root, or a declared
    publish target of its own topology; anything else is zero."

    The live-plugin-root disambiguation line and the (filtered) roster rows
    are further gated on `session_repo_is_plane()` — the session's own repo
    must be one of the two doctrine/engine planes before either renders at
    all. In practice this is belt-and-suspenders: a non-plane session's own
    `setup/publish-targets.portable` never declares a `publish-mirror:`
    sigil (that file is this repo's own artifact), so the per-mirror gate
    above already empties `kept_rows` for it — but the plane gate makes that
    invariant structural rather than incidental to what one file happens to
    contain. It shares this function's one fail-open try/except rather than
    getting its own, so a resolver import failure degrades the whole banner
    the same way it already does — no new failure mode.

    Engine-root row (DR-188 Option D): a session's own resolved engine root
    is not foreign identity — the class line already gains that path
    directly from `_root`, independent of the plane gate above, since it is
    self-identity for every session regardless of which repo it started in
    (see the class-line rendering below). The roster loop still needs to
    SKIP that same mirror as a plain "Publish mirror" row — printing it
    twice, once on the class line and once in the roster, would be noise —
    so the loop below matches each roster row's path against `_root` via
    `_same_repo_path` and excludes a match from `kept_rows` before applying
    the own-publish-target gate to what remains.

    Branch leg (2026-08-15): the resolved engine root's checked-out branch
    is appended to the class line so a session can tell klabauter release
    channels (`candidate` vs `main`) apart. Reports off `_root` (the
    resolver's own answer), never `resolve_publish_mirror_roster()` — that
    roster deliberately reads `publish.mirrors.*`, not `repos.claude_klabauter`,
    and would name the wrong channel wherever those keys diverge. Zero-spawn:
    `_read_current_branch_boot()`/`_read_current_full_sha_boot()` are both
    `.git/HEAD`-only reads, no subprocess. Detached HEAD falls back to an
    8-char short sha rather than emitting nothing; no root/no `.git`/any
    other failure leaves the class line exactly as before, inside this same
    fail-open try/except. Word is `branch`, never "channel" — "channel"
    already names a comms channel elsewhere in this corpus.

    Negative-spec — an ordinary clone is a precondition of this leg saying
    anything. Both helpers read `<root>/.git/HEAD` as a directory path, so a
    linked worktree, a submodule, or a `--separate-git-dir` engine root (where
    `.git` is a *file* holding `gitdir: …`) resolves neither branch nor sha and
    renders with no suffix at all — byte-identical to the pre-branch-leg line
    this exists to replace. `claude-klabauter-em` holds the published klabauter
    mirror to an ordinary clone as a named precondition rather than an
    assumption; a gitdir-indirection rung is deliberately NOT built here on
    speculation, and wants a live consumer before it is.

    """Name the plugin root THIS hook is executing from, immediately above the
    publish-mirror roster.

    Why this line exists, and why here. The roster line names a mirror path and
    says `not a peer repo` — which answers "may I memo it?" but never answers
    "is it what's loaded?". Two readers on one day took a roster line as a
    report of the live plugin root and escalated it as a resolution defect; a
    third had to walk the process table to disprove it. The absence being read
    into is structural, not a lapse in care: nothing else in the boot envelope
    states the loaded root, so the nearest path-shaped line gets pressed into
    the role. Stating it removes the vacuum rather than asking the reader to
    know better.

    Resolved from `__file__`, never `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` and never cwd. This
    file is loaded by the harness from inside the tree it resolved, so its own
    location IS the answer, observed rather than declared — an env var only
    reports what something intended to set. Per CLAUDE.md § Runtime
    conventions, scripts self-resolve their own root.

    The env var is still read, for the single purpose of reporting a
    DISAGREEMENT with the observed root. That divergence is the one genuinely
    alarming state in this area — a hook body executing from one tree while the
    harness advertises another — and it is invisible today. Agreement, and an
    unset var (the ordinary case for a non-plugin-scoped hook invocation),
    render nothing extra.

    Gated on a non-empty roster by its caller: with no mirror registered there
    is no adjacent path to be confused with, so the line would be pure boot
    weight. Fail-open like every other leg of this banner — but structured as
    DECISION then EMISSION, each in its own guarded block, rather than one
    try/except wrapping a branch that also writes: computing `diverged` and
    calling `_w` are two separate guarded steps below, so exactly one `_w`
    call is reachable per invocation and a write failure degrades to silence
    for this one line instead of either truncating the roster that follows or
    emitting the plain line a second time after a partial DISAGREES write.

    Path comparison is IDENTITY, not string equality, and that is a
    multi-OS-P0 requirement rather than fastidiousness. Two spellings of one
    directory must never render as a divergence, and each host family spells
    them differently: Windows brings drive-letter case, `/` vs `\\`, UNC vs
    mapped-drive, and 8.3 short names; macOS brings a case-INSENSITIVE default
    filesystem (APFS/HFS+) that `PurePosixPath.__eq__` compares
    case-SENSITIVELY, so `.../Coordinator` and `.../coordinator` are one
    directory the comparison would call two; both bring symlinks. `Path.__eq__`
    alone is correct on Windows (`PureWindowsPath` casefolds) and WRONG on
    macOS for exactly the case-only spelling, which is why it is not the last
    word here. `os.path.samefile` answers from `st_dev`/`st_ino`, so every one
    of those spellings collapses to the same identity on every host.

# HEAD has essentially ALWAYS drifted since the cache's `generated_at`, so a bare drift check
# fired on effectively every boot (observed directly: leg 2 regenerated pinned to 16b9bba7e,
# and the very next boot -- HEAD already at d3c285d7e -- re-fired against a cache that was
# genuinely fine). A banner that always fires is read by nobody, which recreates this
# spinoff's own failure by a different route (silent-wrong vs. ignored-because-constant). 30
# minutes is comfortably longer than the self-heal loop's cadence (so a healthy loop stays
# quiet) and comfortably shorter than the failure case this banner exists to catch (a cache

    `repomap_staleness_banner` / `exec_summary_staleness_banner`.

    Restores the signal the 2026-07-15 zero-spawn directive removed
    (`handle_cache_present_boot()`'s docstring): a stale cache used to announce itself via a
    git-verified diff; today's boot path re-emits it verbatim with no check at all. See
    `state/handoffs/2026-07-29-orientation-cache-stale-by-construction.md` for the full
    incident (measured 1,575 commits stale, silent).

    Spawn budget: primary resolution is `_read_current_full_sha_boot()`, zero subprocess. Only
    when that pure-Python read fails to produce a SHA does this fall back to a single
    `git rev-parse HEAD` (2.0s timeout) via `_run()` -- never `git status`, whose
    `--porcelain=v2 --branch` form the source audit proposed but which pays a full working-tree
    scan for the one `branch.oid` field this banner needs. This is a deliberate improvement on
    the audit's own costed proposal, not a deviation from it -- see this function's own spawn
    test (`test_orientation_cache_staleness_banner.py`) for the mechanical assertion.

    Comparison is a SHA prefix match: the cache stores `git_head_at_generation` as a short SHA
    (`git rev-parse --short HEAD` at generation time), so `current_full_sha.startswith(cache_head)`
    is the correct freshness test -- an exact-equality check would false-positive-stale on every
    boot. An empty/garbage `cache_head` must NOT match everything (`"".startswith("")` is True in
    Python), so an empty `cache_head` is routed to the UNVERIFIABLE branch below rather than
    ever being compared with `startswith()`.

    Two distinct triggers, two distinct banners -- collapsing them loses information a reader
    needs (PM override, 2026-07-29, reversing this function's original silent-on-unverifiable
    behaviour): **unverifiable** (the `git_head_at_generation` field is absent/empty -- we have
    no evidence either way) fires when `cache_head` is falsy; **stale** (the field is present
    and provably behind current HEAD) fires when it's present but doesn't prefix-match. Silence
    on the unverifiable case would recreate the exact defect this banner exists to close --
    "a cache presents as current when it cannot prove that" is the same failure whether the
    proof is *absent* or *contradicted*. This also matches the full/legacy path's own contract
    (`handle_cache_present()`'s "HEAD unverifiable" branch, several dozen lines above) and keeps
    this boot-time signal consistent with the async self-heal leg, which treats cannot-verify
    the same as stale (regenerates either way).

    Negative-spec -- dirty-tree / `git status` state is NOT part of this check and never will
    be: `state/` on this repo is a shared multi-agent bus (see the handoff above), so
    working-tree state has no meaningful lifetime past a single tool call. Caching or banner-ing
    it here would manufacture exactly the confidently-wrong state this banner exists to end.
    Any consumer needing live dirty-tree state computes it live, at the point of use -- never
    from this hook's boot-time read.

    Not attempted here: an "N commits behind" count. That needs a second spawn
    (`git rev-list --count <cache_head>..HEAD`) this banner's budget does not afford -- do not
    add it casually; naming HEAD drift by SHA + timestamp is enough to point at the remedy.

    Grace window (see `_ORIENTATION_STALENESS_GRACE_MINUTES_DEFAULT` for the measurement): a
    drifted-but-provable cache_head does NOT banner immediately. It only banners once the cache's
    own `generated_at` age exceeds the grace window -- a recently regenerated cache that has
    already drifted a few commits means the self-heal loop is working, and shouting about that is
    noise nobody reads. An unparseable/missing `generated_at` is treated as PAST the grace window
    (unknown age must not buy silence, same principle as the UNVERIFIABLE branch above) -- still
    zero additional spawn, since age comes from a field this function already has in hand. The
    UNVERIFIABLE branch itself is NOT subject to this grace window -- a cache with no
    `git_head_at_generation` at all banners immediately regardless of age.

    Grace is age AND magnitude, not age alone. A young cache buys silence only while its recorded
    HEAD is also still NEAR current HEAD (`_head_drift_is_small_boot`, zero subprocess). Age-only
    grace decouples from the reader's actual experience on a high-cadence shared tree: where
    several agents commit concurrently, ten commits inside the window is an ordinary morning, and
    for all of it the EM reads materially wrong facts with no signal -- which is precisely the
    condition this banner exists to end. "The self-heal loop is working" and "the human is right
    now reading something false" are both true in that window; age-only optimised for the first.
    Magnitude lets them come apart: silent when fresh AND close, banner when far however fresh.
    An UNKNOWN magnitude (no readable reflog) falls back to age-only rather than inventing a
    verdict -- see that helper's own contract.

    B-F4 review finding (resolved): the bash oracle's cache-present block
    ALWAYS short-circuits BEFORE reaching the lightweight check — so
    `--lightweight` has
    ZERO effect whenever `orientation_cache.md` is present; a warm-cache
    /clear still gets the full cached-orientation content, never this
    two-line banner. An earlier draft of this port checked LIGHTWEIGHT
    before opening/diffing the cache file, which meant this branch also
    fired when a cache existed — a genuine divergence from the oracle. That
    has been fixed: `main()` now checks cache-present FIRST (via
    `handle_cache_present_boot()`/`handle_cache_present()`) and only falls
    through to this branch when no cache exists AND `--lightweight` was
    passed, exactly mirroring the oracle's control flow. No PM sign-off
    needed here — this restores oracle parity rather than changing behavior.

    Branch resolution is subprocess-free (`_read_current_branch_boot()`) —
    see that function's docstring for the zero-spawn boot-path rationale.
