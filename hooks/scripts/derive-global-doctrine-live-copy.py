"""PostToolUse(Write|Edit|MultiEdit) AND SessionStart hook: re-derive the
live global CLAUDE.md copy, the live `~/.claude/rules/*.md` mirror, AND the
in-plugin published copy under `coordinator/templates/global-doctrine/`,
whenever their TRACKED sources may have changed.

The third target is what reaches a machine that never clones this repo.
`global-doctrine/` sits at the repo root and percolation is `coordinator/`-only,
so the authoring copy ships nowhere — which is why a cloud VM cloning the OSS
mirror had the engine, the plugin, and no fleet doctrine. Nothing becomes
public that was not already: the substance ships today through
`snippets/em-operating-doctrine.md` and `docs/wiki/posture-anchors.md`; only
the assembled always-loaded file was missing.

Why this exists — the mirror direction is TRACKED -> LIVE, not the reverse:
`global-doctrine/CLAUDE.md` (tracked, in this repo) is the authoring target;
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (live, harness-loaded) is DERIVED from it. Before this
hook, nothing performed that derivation — a human had to notice
`coordinator/tests/test_global_doctrine_tracked_copy.py` go red and manually
run `cp global-doctrine/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. That is exactly the
failure shape this repo's north star (`coordinator/docs/wiki/
invisible-doctrine.md`) names: a rule whose only discharge is "the operator
remembers." This hook makes the derivation automatic.

Two triggers, one hazard the Write|Edit-only original missed: the tracked
source on this shared-branch repo changes far more often via `git pull` /
`checkout` / `merge` / a peer session's commit than via a tool-mediated
Write/Edit -- none of those fire a PostToolUse event, so a Write|Edit-only
registration is structurally blind to the most common way the source
changes. SessionStart closes that gap; Write|Edit stays registered
alongside it for immediacy on the tool-mediated path.

OSS-CLOBBER HAZARD -- read `_is_dev_repo()` before touching the gate below.
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.claude/rules/` are the OPERATOR'S OWN global
config. For anyone running the OSS coordinator-claude distribution they
have nothing to do with this repo, and this hook must NEVER derive into
them there. On a Write|Edit match the incidental protection was "an OSS
install has no global-doctrine/CLAUDE.md (or global-doctrine/rules/), so
the path never matches" -- SessionStart carries no file_path payload to run
that same incidental check against, so the dev-repo sentinel gate below is
load-bearing, not defense-in-depth, for that trigger. It must be impossible
by construction for a non-dev checkout to reach either mirrored target, not
merely unlikely.

The `rules/*.md` mirror is copy-in only, never prune: a file present in the
live `~/.claude/rules/` but absent from tracked `global-doctrine/rules/` is
left completely alone -- never deleted, moved, or warned-about. The
operator may keep rules files there that this repo does not own.

Contract (matches the house PostToolUse-advisory convention used by
nudge-initiative-goals-ladder.py -- exit 2 + stderr reaches the model's next
turn without blocking; exit 0 + silence is the non-firing no-op):
  stdin   -- PostToolUse JSON (tool_name, tool_input.file_path, ...) OR
             SessionStart JSON (no tool_input/file_path)
  stderr  -- one advisory line ONLY when a real derivation happened (drift
             found and corrected) or a genuine failure occurred
  exit 2  -- advisory fired: content actually changed (success) or a
             read/write failure occurred
  exit 0  -- non-firing no-op: gate failed (not the dev repo, path did not
             match, no tracked source), OR the live copy was already
             byte-identical to the tracked source (nothing to do). NOTHING
             on stdout/stderr in either sub-case -- per this repo's own
             wiki (coordinator/docs/wiki/eager-agent-calibration.md §
             "A Check That Speaks Only on Drift Is Free to Run Anywhere"),
             a check silent on the clean state costs nothing to run on
             every SessionStart across the fleet.

Fail-loud, not fail-silent, on the ONE path this hook is responsible for
(the tracked file matched, but read or write failed) -- a bare
`except Exception: pass` here would silently reintroduce the exact staleness
gap this hook exists to close (the same P1 shape recently found and fixed in
check-claude-md-size.py's unreadable-existing-file handling). Every OTHER
guard (path did not match, repo root undiscoverable, not the dev repo, live
already in sync) fails open/silent by design, per this hook's own no-op
contract above.

Portability: macOS + Windows. No subprocess/`cp` -- `shutil.copyfile` only.
Repo root is resolved from `Path(__file__)` upward (parents[3]: scripts ->
hooks -> coordinator -> repo root), never from cwd or a hardcoded path.

Spec backlink: coordinator/tests/test_global_doctrine_tracked_copy.py,
coordinator/tests/test_derive_global_doctrine_live_copy.py

Review: code-reviewer -- Finding 4: the session_start_mode branch in main()
is presently reachable only via direct/manual invocation and this file's
own tests -- no registered hooks.json entry sends this script a
SessionStart payload today, and sweep-boot.py's fold-in bypasses main()
entirely, calling _is_dev_repo() / _tracked_path() / _derive_live_copy()
directly.

Advisory prose routes through `_message_envelope.compose` (280-char
prose ceiling; see `coordinator/hooks/scripts/_message_envelope.py`). The
mirror-direction/OSS-clobber/fail-loud reasoning above is the full
explanation; each composer below carries only the diagnosis, pointing at
`_WIKI_ANCHOR` for the rest -- see this hook's own relocation fragment
(state/relocations/guard-message-cap/derive-global-doctrine-live-copy.py.md).
