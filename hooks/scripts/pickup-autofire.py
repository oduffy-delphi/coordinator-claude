"""UserPromptExpansion auto-fire hook for baton grabs (naked Python, no bash).

Purpose: when the EM (or a peer session) types `/pickup <artifact-path>`, this
hook fires ahead of `UserPromptSubmit`, computes the pickup decision object via
the engine-side `pickup-assemble brief` CLI, and injects a rendered summary as
`additionalContext` — so the brief already exists by the time the EM's own
turn starts acting on the command. When the computed decision reads
`coast: clear` with zero unresolved `judgment_points`, the hook ALSO fires the
mutating `pickup-assemble apply` half, propagating the event payload's own
`session_id` explicitly (never relying on ambient tier-4 sentinel resolution
downstream — see `_apply_argv`'s docstring).

The same firing covers an autonomous-run command handed batons on its argument
line. Handing batons to a run IS a grab — the claim is what stops a concurrent
session from picking up the same handoff mid-run, and a run coordinating its
own executors by file-disjointness has no other cross-session guarantee. So the
run's batons brief, claim, and render through this identical path rather than
through a doctrine step the operator has to remember; the only extra work is
filtering the baton paths out of a mixed argument string that also carries
flags, item identifiers, and plan paths (`extract_baton_paths`). Naming no
baton passes silently, leaving an ordinary backlog run untouched.

Contract (mirrors the sibling hooks in this directory):
  stdin   -- UserPromptExpansion JSON (command_name, command_args,
             command_source, cwd, expansion_type, session_id, prompt_id, ...)
  stdout  -- one `hookSpecificOutput` JSON envelope with `additionalContext`
             when a `pickup`-verb command was matched and a brief could be
             computed; NOTHING otherwise (silent pass — a non-pickup command,
             or a total transport failure, produces no output)
  exit 0  -- always. This hook is advisory/mutating-via-a-vetted-CLI, never a
             blocking gate on the EM's own prompt — see AC9(c) below.

Spec: docs/plans/2026-07-23-computed-skills-bz-pickup-rebuild.md, chunk C3;
AC4, AC9, AC9(a-d), AC11, AC11b. Contract doc:
coordinator/docs/wiki/computed-skills.md (decision-object JSON schema).

Safety envelope (AC9), each clause load-bearing:
  (a) SESSION-ID PROPAGATION, not event filtering. The event payload already
      carries its own originating `session_id` — there is no "foreign
      session" to filter once `command_name` matches a pickup verb (a foreign
      session's prompt cannot match unless that session itself typed it, in
      which case firing is correct). The hazard is downstream: `apply()`
      resolves claiming identity ambiently via `core.resolve_session_id`
      unless told otherwise, and that ambient path returns empty or an
      unrelated id under concurrency ambiguity. This hook passes the
      payload's `session_id` explicitly via `--session-id` (never relies on
      the ambient path) — see `_apply_argv`.
  (b) An absent or unrecognized `coast` verdict reads as HOLD, never as
      permission — see `_coast_verdict`/`_should_apply` (an older engine
      emitting no verdict must never be read as "clear").
  (c) Hook errors / timeouts / transport failures degrade to compute-only
      (or total silence, if even the brief could not be computed) and NEVER
      block `/pickup` — every subprocess call and every JSON decode in this
      module is wrapped to fail open, and `main()` never raises.
  (d) `additionalContext` never exceeds `_CONTEXT_BUDGET_CHARS` (10,000).
      Over-budget degrades per the rendering priority list `narration ->
      verdict -> next_move -> your_call -> pointer -> evidence`, dropped from
      the tail (evidence first, then the pointer line) — `next_move` and
      `your_call` (C4b) are never dropped, only the narration text is
      hard-truncated as a last resort. See `render_additional_context`.
      # Review: code-reviewer — module docstring's AC9(d) summary was
      # unchanged when C4b promoted `your_call` to a protected segment;
      # `render_additional_context`'s own docstring already documented it.

Never overrides a denied claim — there is no override code path in this
module at all; `_should_apply` only returns True on `coast: clear`, which
`compute_coast` (engine-side) never reports when `claim_grant.verdict ==
"denied"` (a denied claim always reads `coast: blocked`).

Install-surface note (recorded, not discovered at dogfood): the spike found
that a newly-registered `UserPromptExpansion` hook required `/reload-plugins`
before it started firing — a plain hooks.json edit alone was not enough (that
distinguishes it from other hook types the spike also touched, whose config
hot-reloaded without a restart).

Skill-tool-firing measurement (the Staff Engineer second-pass finding #9, same
instrumentation pass, near-zero marginal cost): `_log_probe_event` appends one
JSON line per hook firing (regardless of command match) to a tempfile-backed
log, recording `command_source`/`expansion_type` alongside `command_name` and
`session_id`. Whether a `Skill`-tool (programmatic, EM-initiated) invocation
of `/pickup` fires `UserPromptExpansion` at all is NOT something this
sandboxed authoring pass could determine — that requires an actual live
Skill-tool call inside a running Claude Code session, which is outside this
authoring context's reach. Once this hook is registered and `/reload-plugins`
run, a live dogfood pass (typed `/pickup <path>` vs. `Skill(pickup, ...)`)
can `grep` the probe log's `command_source`/`expansion_type` fields for both
invocation shapes and settle it empirically. See this chunk's final report
for the current disposition.

Cross-repo consumer contract (negative-spec, closes the discharge-test gap
flagged in review): this hook is a HARD consumer of the engine repo's
`pickup-assemble brief`/`apply` CLI's output shape, pinned as of the engine
repo's commit `67828ff1` and the `main()` branch at
`coordinator_core/pickup_assemble/__init__.py:3868-3886` that emits it:
  - **N==1** grab → the CLI prints a BARE decision object (`{...}`), never a
    wrapped envelope.
  - **N>1** grab (an ` AND `-joined multi-artifact command) → the CLI prints
    a BARE JSON array of decision objects (`[{...}, {...}, ...]`) — NOT a
    `{"briefs": [...]}`-wrapped dict, and not any other envelope shape. A
    wrapped dict is a bare object as far as this hook's decoder is
    concerned (DEC-2) and is treated as ONE (almost certainly malformed)
    baton, never silently unwrapped into its `briefs` elements — there is
    no such unwrapping code path anywhere in this module.
  - **Process exit code** = the worst (max) per-artifact exit across the
    whole payload — this hook does not itself compute or re-derive that
    number; it only decodes whatever JSON the CLI already emitted to
    stdout.
A future engine-side change to this shape (e.g. switching to a wrapper
envelope) breaks this hook silently (fail-open swallows the parse failure
into "no output") unless a round-trip contract fixture on the engine side
also pins it — see chunk C7's cross-repo ask.

    `pointer_paths` (docs/plans/2026-08-07-pickup-hold-path-decision-file-

    path). N>1 (or N==0 written against N>1 decisions) names every written
    path on its own line so the EM is never pointed at a file `apply` will
    not read.

    sacrifice at all, whole later-baton (verdict, next_move, your_call)

    any raw character slice is applied -- this keeps `next_move`/`your_call`
    intact for every baton that survives the drop; only the earliest
    surviving baton's own segment is ever raw-sliced, and only when it alone
    still overflows the budget. For N==1 with no prose tail and no
    guidance-bearing judgment_points (`your_call_text` is None, contributing
    nothing to the join) this reduces to exactly the pre-existing
    single-object behavior (AC3): the same 3 non-empty protected segments in

    Fires ONLY on a turn `expansion_type` confirms is a typed slash command

    "plugin"` / `expansion_type: "slash_command"`, and the corrected
    staleness bound holds the value stable across every OTHER turn until the
    next one) -- checking `expansion_type` directly rather than assuming
    every firing of this hook is itself a slash-command turn, per the plan's
    explicit instruction not to assume that.

    Three outcomes, per D6's contract on `producer_set`'s `typed_command`
    parameter:
      - a confirmed slash command whose `command_name` normalizes to a
        non-empty string -> that normalized name (the common case).

        expected and did not resolve" signal -- NOT silently skipped, which

      - anything not confirmed a slash command -> no call at all, leaving
        the prior value in place per D3's persistence bound.

    A `False` return from `producer_set` (lock acquisition failed -- nothing
