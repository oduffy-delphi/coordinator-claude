"""SessionStart sync fan-in dispatcher -- five hooks.json SessionStart
registrations, one interpreter, source-gated.

Folds `project-orientation.py`, `guard-settings-integrity.py`,
`guard-foreign-platform-paths.py`, `session-start-write-bump-anchor.py`,
and `guard-hook-generation-self-probe.py` into ONE
`python3` process, registered on the UNION of their prior matchers
(`startup|resume|clear|compact|fork`), following the registry +
dynamic-import pattern `stop-dispatch.py` / `preuse-agent-dispatch.py`
already ship.

`assert-em-role.py` (C1b) is NOT folded here as of
docs/plans/2026-08-29-restore-em-boot-payload-delivery.md chunk C1: it is
its OWN top-level SessionStart registration in hooks.json again, on the
same `startup|resume|clear|compact|fork` matcher it always carried. Its
payload was measured reaching a session's actual context in 4 of 279
archived transcripts carrying the marker -- riding this shared fan-in's
one stdout stream meant its output was captured but truncated away before
becoming EM context in the other 275. A separate top-level registration
gives it its own stdout stream and therefore its own preview window,
independent of every other guard folded here. Reordering it to run first
inside this same process was rejected: delivery would then depend on no
sibling leg ever growing its own output, which is the same fragility
relocated rather than fixed. See `assert-em-role.py`'s own hooks.json
entry for the restored registration.

NOT folded, deliberately (see state/subagent-share/892113a3-8c0c-4fa8-bb68-
13c20ca4aad5/coordinatorexecutor-ef3486a7.md for the full reasoning):
  - `sweep-boot.py` -- explicit handoff instruction (state/handoffs/
    2026-08-16-untitled-6c1eb4ae.md § Next Steps 1): its 30s timeout must
    not hide behind a short one. Stays its own standalone registration.
  - `session-start-register-doe-claude-root.py` and `session-start-repair-
    prepare-commit-msg-hook.py` -- both registered `async: true` in the
    prior manifest (their whole value is a side-effect write with no
    context-bound stdout, DELIBERATELY kept off boot-latency). Folding an
    async hook into a SYNC dispatcher process would force it to block
    session start, a real behaviour change this fold does not make
    unilaterally -- see `sessionstart-async-dispatch.py`, which folds
    those two instead, preserving their async-ness exactly.

SOURCE-GATING, NOT MATCHER-NARROWING. Across the nine registrations that
predate the 2026-08-16 fan-in, matchers spanned FOUR distinct sets:
`startup|clear|compact` (four of the five folded HERE: project-orientation.py,
guard-settings-integrity.py, guard-foreign-platform-paths.py,
guard-hook-generation-self-probe.py), `startup|resume|clear|compact|fork`
(the other one folded here, session-start-write-bump-anchor.py --
assert-em-role.py shared this matcher too but is no longer folded into
this dispatcher, see above), `startup|compact` (sweep-boot.py --
deliberately NOT folded, see above), and `startup` alone
(session-start-repair-prepare-commit-msg-hook.py -- folded into
sessionstart-async-dispatch.py instead, see above). This dispatcher folds
only the first two of those four sets -- the five guards in REGISTRY below --
registered on their union (`startup|resume|clear|compact|fork`). Narrowing
HERE, per guard, on the harness's own SessionStart payload `source` field
(confirmed present and enumerated exactly as
`startup|resume|clear|compact|fork` by the vendored docs,
`state/reference/anthropic-docs/claude-code/hooks.md` § SessionStart Input
fields -- not inferred from the matcher strings) reproduces each guard's
ORIGINAL firing set exactly, never wider. A guard whose `sources` frozenset
does not contain the payload's `source` is skipped entirely (not imported,
not invoked) for that boot. An ABSENT/empty `source` runs every guard --
fail-open on the classification, matching this repo's pervasive fail-open
posture rather than narrowing a firing set on a missing signal.

A NON-EMPTY but unrecognised `source` skips every guard, which is what the
pre-fold registrations did too: the harness's own matcher gate would not
have fired a hook enumerating `startup|resume|clear|compact|fork` against
an unknown source string either, so this is not a narrowing the fold
introduces. It is unreachable today -- the vendored docs enumerate exactly
those five values. It becomes reachable the moment a harness release adds a
sixth and someone widens the hooks.json matcher WITHOUT adding it to the
per-guard `sources` sets below, and the whole cohort would then go silent.
That is why `_UNMATCHED_SOURCE_BREADCRUMB` exists: the cohort still skips,
but it never skips quietly. Harness enumerations do drift -- assume this
fires eventually rather than that it is dead code.

INCREMENTAL FLUSH, NOT COLLECT-THEN-WRITE-ONCE (load-bearing, not a style
choice). `stop-dispatch.py` and `preuse-agent-dispatch.py` both accumulate
every guard's captured stdout/stderr and write once at the end. This
dispatcher CANNOT do that: `guard-hook-generation-self-probe.py`'s own
`main()` calls `os._exit(0)` on its documented ThreadPoolExecutor-timeout
fail-open path (its own module docstring: the only portable way to leave a
hung non-daemon worker behind without wedging the interpreter). `os._exit`
bypasses every `finally`/context-manager `__exit__` in this process,
including this dispatcher's own -- so if this dispatcher accumulated output
in memory and wrote it once at the end, self-probe's `os._exit(0)` would
silently discard every EARLIER guard's already-collected output along with
it, an outcome none of those guards' own fail-open contracts intend. This
dispatcher instead writes each guard's captured stdout/stderr to the REAL
`sys.__stdout__`/`sys.__stderr__` immediately after that guard returns,
before moving to the next -- so an `os._exit()` from any guard (self-probe
today; anything folded here in the future) only ever discards that guard's
OWN unflushed output, never a sibling's. `guard-hook-generation-self-probe`
is ALSO placed last in `REGISTRY` as belt-and-suspenders (nothing folded
here runs after it to lose), but the incremental-flush design is the actual
fix -- ordering alone would not protect a future re-ordering.

NO SHARED-ROOT INJECTION (unlike `stop-dispatch.py`'s `_git_root_walk`
share). None of these six guards resolve a plain git repo root; each
resolves `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / the engine root independently via its
own `_resolve_claude_klabauter_root()` -- a different, guard-specific resolution this
dispatcher does not attempt to unify (out of scope; see the settings.json
triple-read note below).

SETTINGS.JSON TRIPLE-READ (named, not fixed here). Three of these guards
(`guard-settings-integrity.py`, `guard-foreign-platform-paths.py`,
`guard-hook-generation-self-probe.py`) each independently resolve
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`/`settings.json` and call a THIN DoE-side stub that
hands off to an engine-plane function, which does its OWN independent
file read. Folding these three into one process does not, by itself,
collapse that to one read: the read lives inside each engine function's
own body (`coordinator_core.ops.session.*`), an engine-plane surface this
repo holds no commit grant to edit without per-session PM assent
(`CLAUDE.md` § Place in the fleet). A shared read is possible only if
those three engine functions grew a parameter accepting pre-read settings
content -- an engine-plane change, not something this fold can do
unilaterally. Not fixed in this dispatch; flagged for the engine side.

`project-orientation.py` takes `argv` (it needs `--lightweight`, matching
its ONLY production invocation shape).
