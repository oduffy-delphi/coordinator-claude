"""Undischarged-next-move watchdog -- ledger emission/discharge + one-shot Stop read.

Spec backlink: docs/plans/2026-08-10-posture-scaled-autonomous-disposition.md
(chunk C3, "THE HEADLINE CHUNK").

THE PROBLEM (see the plan's own Problem section for the fuller account): an
EM ends its turn having NARRATED a machine-resolved next move instead of
taking it -- "next, a named Opus reviewer", "shall I dispatch?" -- and the
session halts for no reason a human needed to supply. This module is the
generalisation of `nudge-unrouted-sizing.py` (one seam, engine-resident) to
three doctrine-plane-resident seams behind a session-scoped ledger
(`_next_move_ledger.py`).

WHY THIS IS NOT THE STOOD-DOWN WATCHER. `runtime-tripwire-stop-watcher.py`
inferred a STATE ("is this session stalled?") from timing and transcript
shape, fired 681 times in 26 days at ~99.4% wrong, and was stood down by PM
ruling. This module infers NOTHING -- it reads a ledger of obligations that
were themselves opened only by a concrete PostToolUse observation of a
seam-opening call, and closed only by a concrete PostToolUse observation of
the matching terminal call. No timing, idle-duration, or session-age
predicate exists anywhere in this module (grep-asserted by the test suite,
per A5).

TWO EVENTS, ONE SCRIPT. Registered on BOTH `PostToolUse` (matcher
`Skill|Agent`) and `Stop` (matcher ""); `main()` branches on the payload
shape (`tool_name` a string -> PostToolUse; else `transcript_path` present
-> Stop) since the two events carry different stdin shapes and neither
wire format currently sends a distinguishing `hook_event_name` field to
naked-Python hooks. The PostToolUse branch takes precedence: a payload
carrying a non-string `tool_name` (e.g. `null`) alongside `transcript_path`
still routes to Stop, matching what `_handle_post_tool_use` itself
requires of `tool_name`. This mirrors the existing single-script,
dual-matcher pattern used by `guard-manufactured-blocker.py`'s Stop-only
sibling registrations elsewhere in `hooks.json`.

EMISSION -- a STATIC seam table (`_SEAM_TABLE` below), never an inference.
Five obligations:
  sizing-routed    opens on Skill(coordinator:sizing); the resolved next
                   action is read off the JUST-WRITTEN sizing object's
                   `route` (via the session's git `touch-record.jsonl`, same
                   technique `guard-manufactured-blocker.py` uses to find
                   "the session's routed sizing object" -- reimplemented
                   here as a self-contained line-scan, no shared import,
                   matching this corpus's DR-047/DR-118 posture on tiny
                   independently-failing-open transport helpers).
  plan->review     opens on Skill(coordinator:plan) ONLY when that same
                   sizing object's route is exactly "plan" (the FULL
                   terminal). A route of "spec-dispatch" does NOT open this
                   obligation -- its terminal is an executor dispatch, not
                   review, and that obligation is already covered by
                   sizing-routed opened at sizing time.
  execute->wave    opens on Skill(coordinator:execute-plan); discharged by
                   the next Agent dispatch. Needs no sizing object: this
                   skill's terminal is fixed by the skill itself ("no
                   per-chunk reviewer gate ... ship Phase N green, dispatch
                   Phase N+1 immediately, no checkpoint offer"), so a turn
                   that enters plan execution and ends without dispatching
                   anything is the undischarged case by construction, with
                   no route lookup needed to know it.
  review-a1-a2     opens on Skill(coordinator:review); discharged by the
                   next Agent dispatch (the reviewer persona named at A.2
                   varies per review -- the Staff Engineer/the Game Dev Reviewer/the Data Science Reviewer/the Front-End Reviewer/the UX Reviewer/the Director of Engineering --
                   and none of those names is a fixed `subagent_type` this
                   module can match against, so discharge is a deliberately
                   broad "any Agent call after Skill(coordinator:review)"
                   rather than a narrower, unverifiable persona match).
  pickup->next-move
                   opens on Skill(coordinator:pickup), unconditionally --
                   pickup is mutually exclusive with sizing, so there is
                   no sizing object to read a route off, and the whole
                   lane was invisible while emission required one. Its
                   terminal is heterogeneous (apply a handoff, dispatch an
                   executor, mint a successor), so it discharges on ANY
                   subsequent Skill OR Agent call -- the `Skill|Agent`
                   wildcard kind, the same "no verifiable identity" logic
                   as review-a1-a2 widened one step.

ROUTE TERMINALS -- only routes with a machine-resolved next call get an
obligation opened at all (`_ROUTE_TERMINAL` below): `dispatch`/
`spec-dispatch` -> an executor dispatch (Agent tool); `plan`/`shape`/
`roadmap` -> Skill(coordinator:plan) (the route mints a plan next).
`pm-decision` and `goal-setting` are deliberately ABSENT from the table --
their whole point is that the next move is a PM call, not a machine-
resolved one, and `pm-decision` with `xl_exit: null` is additionally
covered by the exemption predicate below regardless of table membership.

EXEMPTIONS -- copied from `nudge-unrouted-sizing.py`'s own discipline (and
reimplemented, self-contained, the same way `guard-manufactured-blocker.py`
reimplements it): an unresolved appetite/post-size fork, or a
`route: pm-decision` sizing object carrying `xl_exit: null`, is a
legitimate PM-pending state and must NOT open an obligation.

ONE FIRE PER OBLIGATION (A6) -- `_next_move_ledger.mark_fired` is the latch;
a second Stop with the same obligation open finds it already fired and
stays silent. A guard that repeats is the nag the PM has already rejected.

MESSAGE SHAPE (A7) -- the fired message carries the obligation's literal
`next_action` string (e.g. "Skill(coordinator:review)"), never an
exhortation to keep going.

SEVERITY BY POSTURE -- `precision`: advisory via stdout, exit 0 (byte-
identical to today, per A8). `default`/`substrate-free`: stderr, exit 2
(the Stop-family blocking shape `nudge-unrouted-sizing.py` and
`nudge-harness-directive-dispatch.py` already use), so the turn does not
end and the EM continues in-turn with the command in hand.

Contract:
  PostToolUse stdin  -- tool_name, tool_input, session_id, cwd, agent_id...
  PostToolUse stdout -- nothing, ever (this leg is silent bookkeeping)
  Stop stdin         -- session_id, transcript_path, cwd, stop_hook_active,
                        agent_id...
  Stop stdout        -- the correction text, at posture `precision` only
  Stop stderr        -- the correction text, at posture `default`/
                        `substrate-free` only
  exit 2             -- Stop leg fires at a blocking posture
  exit 0             -- every other path, including every failure path
                        (fail-open, both legs, unconditionally)

Graceful degradation: any failure to read stdin, parse JSON, resolve the
repo root, or read the ledger falls through to a silent no-op / exit 0.
