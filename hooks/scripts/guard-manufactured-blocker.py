"""Stop-hook guard — the manufactured-blocker check (off-altitude items in
end-of-turn PM handoffs).

Spec backlink: docs/plans/2026-08-10-posture-scaled-autonomous-disposition.md
(chunk C5); "A fourth shape, and the one the ledger cannot see" in that plan's
Problem section is the motivating incident this guard encodes.

THE PROBLEM. An EM closed a turn: "Three things now wait on you: the cascade
exit-code call (blocks the fix), the retro --write (now sequenced behind it),
and the doctrine-plane negative-spec entry." The PM's reaction supplies the test this
guard applies: "I don't even know what these things are, but I'm sure they're
EM calls. It's the 'wait on you' and that sort of crap. No it doesn't. These
are EM things." A second, subtler family says the same thing by assertion
rather than by an overt handoff clause -- "genuinely yours", "still yours, and
unchanged", "that's a PM call, not mine" -- tagging an item as PM-owned
without demonstrating it is. The PM names this a tic: the possessive does the
work no analysis did, and a softening qualifier ("genuinely", "actually",
"still") is an AGGRAVATING signal, not a mitigating one.

THE TEST -- copied, not re-derived. It exists as the plan skill's B.0
doubt-check un-gaming clause, which disqualifies tactical uncertainties
(naming, test framework, commit shape, file structure) as "off-altitude,
not merely low-stakes", however unsure the author is. That clause has TWO
route-keyed arms since the route segmentation -- the full triad in
`plan-corpus.md`, a proportional falsifiability arm in
`spec-dispatch-corpus.md` -- so cite it by name rather than by file: an
S-lane EM never loads the `plan` segment, and a message naming a file its
reader cannot open is worse than one naming none.

This guard applies the same discriminator to
end-of-turn reports: a genuine PM call concerns scope, deliverable, or
product direction, and states itself in the PM's vocabulary. If the PM would
not recognise the nouns, it is an EM call -- decide it, do not hand it up.

WHY THIS IS NOT THE STOOD-DOWN WATCHER. `runtime-tripwire-stop-watcher.py`
inferred a STATE ("is this session abandoned?") from timing and transcript
shape, fired 681 times in 26 days at ~99.4% wrong, and was stood down by PM
ruling. This guard matches a SPEECH ACT the EM literally wrote in its own
final message -- the trigger text is right there in the output, nothing is
inferred. No timing, idle-duration, or session-age predicate exists anywhere
in this module (grep-asserted by the test suite, same discipline as A5).

SCOPE OF THE READ. Stop hooks receive a transcript path. This module reads
ONLY the final assistant message -- never the whole conversation -- which is
what keeps it a cheap `command` hook.

EXEMPTIONS ARE LOAD-BEARING (A13). A real PM gate must never be suppressed --
a false fire here is worse than a miss, because it trains the EM to route
around a genuine gate. Silent pass when any of these hold, checked against
the same turn's sizing state and a SCOPED window of the final-message text
(the sentence carrying the C5 trigger plus one sentence either side -- never
the whole message; see EXEMPTION SCOPE below for why):
  - the session's routed sizing object carries an unresolved appetite/post-
    size fork (`fork: null` with the matching detent open) or an unresolved
    XL exit (`route: pm-decision`, `xl_exit: null`) -- predicate copied from
    the sibling engine's `nudge_unrouted_sizing` op (`_appetite_fork_open` /
    `_post_size_prompt_open`), reimplemented here as a self-contained
    line-scan (no YAML dependency, matching `_posture.py`'s own stdlib-only
    convention) since this guard has no sibling engine op to delegate to.
    Conjunctive with the trigger window, like the other lexical exemptions:
    the on-disk fork must be open AND the C5 trigger sentence must itself be
    about the size of the ask. An open post-size prompt exempts the sentence
    that ASKS it -- never every possessive construct sharing the turn, which
    would silence C5 for the whole of any session sized M or above, i.e. in
    exactly the sessions whose reports carry multiple items. A recorded
    `pm_resolution` block closes the fork on its own: the engine always emits
    `fork` null and the schema fills it only on a cut-/raise-shaped answer,
    so `fork` alone cannot witness a PM answer of "go with that";
  - an ask-before-external-action is pending (an irreversible/external act
    named without pre-authorization already granted);
  - a conflict of interest / wrong signatory (the EM is structurally
    disqualified from acting -- e.g. a two-decider record naming the EM as
    one of the deciders, so the EM ratifying its own authorship is the wrong
    signature regardless of how well it understands the content). Lexical,
    two halves with DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT scope (A13 finding 1's
    resolution): a standalone phrase ("wrong signature", "ratifying my own
    authorship", "two-decider"/"named deciders" construct) is checked
    against the scoped window like the other exemption above, since
    the phrase is self-contained and its appearing far from the trigger is
    exactly the incidental-co-occurrence failure mode this guard must not
    reward. An authorship admission ("I wrote/authored it") co-occurring
    with ratification vocabulary (sign-off/ratify/approve) is checked
    against the WHOLE message on purpose and stays that way -- the
    admission and the ratification ask legitimately sit in different
    sentences of a real wrong-signatory report, so narrowing this half
    would break genuine cases, not just incidental ones. Neither half alone
    is enough, so an ordinary "I wrote the plan, so the approach call is
    yours" still fires the ordinary handoff check.
The exemption check applies identically to BOTH pattern groups below -- the
discriminator is never the phrasing, it is whether one of these three actually
holds.

EXEMPTION SCOPE (A13 finding 1, live incident). The two lexical exemptions
above were originally checked against the whole final message -- so an EM
final message that both (a) genuinely hands an item to the PM and (b)
separately mentions this guard's own exemption vocabulary while discussing
something else entirely (e.g. summarizing the exemption list, or writing a
retro about this very guard) got silently exempted, with no observable
signal. `_trigger_window_text` narrows the check to the sentence carrying
the actual C5 trigger plus one sentence of surrounding context on each
side -- wide enough for a legitimate exemption phrasing that spans two
adjacent sentences (e.g. "before I force-push, may I get your
authorization? Your call --"), narrow enough that a mention several
sentences away, for an unrelated reason, no longer silently exempts.

SIZING EXEMPTION'S SECOND SCOPE (Chunk B, docs/plans/2026-08-11-stop-the-
guard-splat.md; the section proven by direct execution against a
reconstructed scenario matching the real on-disk sizing object's shape --
no confirmed live guard fire is attributed to this gap). A turn that
closes an appetite/post-size fork can legitimately report an UNRELATED PM
item first (e.g. a genuine "your call" scope question) and only THEN ask
the post-size prompt as its closing line -- the engine emits that prompt
to CLOSE the turn, so it can land past the ±1-sentence trigger window.
The sizing topic check therefore ALSO runs against the message's own
final sentence (`_final_sentence`), but ONLY when that final sentence is
the sentence immediately following the trigger window, with no
intervening filler sentence -- never as an unconditional second location,
and never merely because it falls outside the window. Consulting the
final sentence whenever it is merely outside the window (regardless of
distance) would let ANY final sentence carrying sizing vocabulary exempt
the whole turn no matter how far from the trigger, reopening A13 finding
1's incidental-co-occurrence failure mode at final-sentence scope; the
adjacency requirement keeps it to the one structural shape this fix
targets (trigger, its ±1 context, then the engine's own closing prompt
immediately after).

SEVERITY BY POSTURE: advisory (stdout, exit 0) at `precision`; blocking
(stderr, exit 2, Stop-family shape) at `default`/`substrate-free`, matching
`nudge-unrouted-sizing.py` and `nudge-harness-directive-dispatch.py` -- this
applies to the altitude verdict (C5) only.

SECOND VERDICT BRANCH (C6, A15-A17). C5 answers "is this the PM's call?".
This branch answers what comes after a YES: "can the PM actually answer it
as written?" -- checked once an item survives C5 (no trigger, or a triggered
item that an A13 exemption cleared). Detection is lexical (module-level
pattern data, same style as the two groups above): a bare identifier with no
plain-language gloss, the choice named as a category ("a scope call") rather
than stated, or no recommendation anywhere in the message. This branch is
UNCONDITIONALLY advisory-only, hardcoded rather than posture-gated -- it
never returns exit 2, at any posture. Suppressing a genuine PM decision for
being worded badly is the one unrecoverable failure on this surface; the
worst permitted outcome is that the EM restates it.

Contract:
  stdin   -- Stop JSON (session_id, transcript_path, cwd, stop_hook_active, agent_id...)
  stdout  -- the correction text, at posture `precision` only
  stderr  -- the correction text, at posture `default`/`substrate-free` only
  exit 2  -- guard fires at a blocking posture (blocks the stop; stderr shown to Claude)
  exit 0  -- every other path, including every failure path (fail-open)

Graceful degradation: any failure to read stdin, parse the transcript, or
resolve posture falls through to a silent exit 0 (posture resolution itself
already fails open to "precision" -- see `_posture.py`).
