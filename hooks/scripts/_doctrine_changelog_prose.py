"""Shared detector for changelog-shaped prose in coordinator doctrine surfaces.

A doctrine surface states the rule as it stands now, present tense, addressed
to the reader who has to obey it next. It does not carry the rule's history —
ruling dates, `DR-` supersession chains, "was P now Q", "retired on <date>",
origin-incident narration. That standing rule lives in this repo's own
`CLAUDE.md` § Conventions ("Doctrine is not changelog. State the rule as it
stands, present tense... history belongs in commits, decisions, plans.");
this module is the write-time and ratchet-test detector for it.

Governed surfaces: `coordinator/{skills,agents,commands,snippets,docs/wiki}/**/*.md`
(excluding any `tests/`/`fixtures/` subdirectory anywhere in the relative
path, and any basename in `_EXEMPT_BASENAMES` -- a file whose own stated
purpose is to BE a changelog, e.g. `changelog-history.md`, not a doctrine
surface this module's rule applies to) and the `description`/`$comment`
string VALUES inside `coordinator/schemas/*.schema.json` (direct children
only, matching the governing glob literally — not
`coordinator/schemas/fixtures/*.schema.json`).

`x-bump-note`/`x-bump-class` JSON keys are OUT of scope by construction, not
by omission: this module only walks `description`/`$comment` values, so a
changelog-shaped field that exists precisely to carry changelog content never
enters the walk. Widening the walk to catch it would flag a field whose whole
job is to hold the history this module exists to keep OUT of every other
field.

Consumers — both import `iter_violations()`/`new_violations()` from here
rather than keeping a second copy of the regexes:
  - `coordinator/hooks/scripts/guard-doctrine-changelog-prose.py` — PreToolUse
    advisory. Uses `new_violations()` so only the CURRENT write's own new
    hits fire, never the corpus's pre-existing debt.
  - `coordinator/tests/test_doctrine_surfaces_are_not_changelogs.py` —
    ratchet test. Uses `iter_violations()` against each file's full current
    text and compares the per-file COUNT to a checked-in baseline.

Two governed file CLASSES, one shared module
----------------------------------------------
`scope_class(path)` names which of two classes a path belongs to --
`"doctrine"` (the prose corpus documented above, governed by
`DOCTRINE_MD_DIRS`/`DOCTRINE_SCHEMAS_DIR`) or `"config"` (a repo-root
`coordinator.local.md`, resolved from the CANDIDATE PATH's own nearest
`.git` ancestor, never by comparison against this module's `REPO_ROOT` --
`REPO_ROOT` names the plugin's own tree, which is the wrong repo for every
sibling that mirrors this module). `is_in_scope()` stays the boolean either
class implies. The config class is scanned by its own, tier-free predicate
(`_scan_config_line`) rather than the prose rules above -- config debt wears
none of the shapes those rules were tuned to catch. Both classes route
through `iter_violations()`/`new_violations()` via an explicit
`is_config`/`is_json` caller-supplied selector, never a path sniff.

Two confidence tiers, not one
------------------------------
`Violation.confidence` is `"high"` or `"ambiguous"`. HIGH-confidence hits are
the signal classes a 53-file classification probe (plus two corpus-wide
follow-up sweeps) found reliable: a history verb within ~15 tokens of an ISO
date, a paragraph-leading `Origin:`/`Rationale (<date>):`/`Update <date>:`/
`Added <date>:` construction, an explicit two-`DR-`-id supersession chain, a
dated provenance tag, and a bare dated parenthetical.

`_HISTORY_VERB` widened past the original stem set (`retir*`, `remov*`,
`delet*`, `kill*`, `deprecat*`, `supersed*`, `formerly`, `previously`,
`renam*`, `amend*`, `narrow*`, `re-spec'd`, `ruled down`, `used to`, `no
longer`) to also cover `demoted`, `promoted`, `added`, `landed`, `shipped`,
`completion`, `reversed`, `relocated`, `moved`, `dropped`, `restored`,
`widened`, `corrected`, `confirmed` -- a corpus sample of the lines a bare
`grep` for dates/DR-ids found but the original verb set missed (`` `/fan-out`
demoted 2026-05-30 ``, `added ENVELOPE_VERSION 5 (E-RUNTIME,
2026-05-1...)`). These are literal words, not `\\w*` stems like the original
set, deliberately: several of them (`moved`, `dropped`, `restored`,
`corrected`, `confirmed`) are common enough in their present-tense/gerund
forms (`moves`, `dropping`, `confirming`) that stemming them would widen the
match surface into ordinary operative prose that happens to sit near an
unrelated date, not just the historical-narration shape being targeted.

A bare dated parenthetical -- `the callee inherits the same scrubbed env
(2026-07-04, coordinator-core-shim P0)` -- carries no verb and no provenance
keyword, so neither `_HISTORY_VERB` nor `_PROVENANCE_KEYWORDS` sees it, yet
the shape is exactly the same defect: a claim dated as though the date were
load-bearing. `_bare_dated_parenthetical_hit` catches a parenthesized or
italicized span containing a bare date token not preceded by an operative-
threshold cue (`pre`/`before`/`since`/`as of`). It fires ONLY as a fallback
-- `if not violations` in `_scan_text_line` -- after every other rule has
had a chance to claim the line, so it never double-counts a passage another
rule already caught under a more specific kind.

Dated provenance tags — a rule stated correctly in present tense, tagged
with an empirical-basis citation like `(Source: 2026-06-26, project-rag)` or
a trailing italicized `*2026-06-26, project-rag*` — are the largest single
bucket in the corpus. The remedy is narrower than the other high-confidence
classes: strip the DATE, keep the ATTRIBUTION (`(Source: 2026-06-26,
project-rag)` becomes `(Source: project-rag)`), because the attribution
itself is a live fact about where the rule's empirical basis comes from,
while the date is when someone last checked it. Detected via
`_PROVENANCE_KEYWORDS` (`Source`/`Origin`/`Encoded`/`Established` within a
short token window of a bare date token) and `_ITALIC_PROVENANCE` (an
italic `*...*` span pairing a bare date with a trailing attribution via a
comma, in either order). The keyword form dedupes against the
paragraph-leading `Origin:` header rule above via `_is_paragraph_leading` —
a leading `Origin:` construction is narration to rewrite wholesale, not a
tag to trim, so it stays exclusively in that bucket; `Source`/`Encoded`/
`Established` have no such header rule and are always classified as a
provenance tag, leading or not.

The probe also found two classes genuinely ambiguous and handles them
EXPLICITLY rather than folding them into either bucket by accident:

  - `PM ruling` — sometimes bare provenance for a rule that is still fully
    present-tense and live ("by explicit PM ruling, do not add one"),
    sometimes a dated citation for a still-live rule ("Advise, not deny (PM
    ruling, 2026-08-05)" describing a CURRENT state), sometimes reversal
    narration ("PM ruling D5 retired that audit's auto-write"). This module
    flags a hit into the AMBIGUOUS bucket only when the line ALSO carries a
    bare ISO date token (the same date-token detection every other rule in
    this module uses), a history verb (`_HISTORY_VERB`), or a reversal verb
    from the separate, narrower `_PM_RULING_REVERSAL_VERB` set (`flip`,
    `switch`, `change`, `walked back`, `downgrade`, `soften`, `revert`,
    `undone`, `abandon`, `scrap`, and stems) — deliberately kept out of
    `_HISTORY_VERB` because that constant also drives the HIGH-confidence
    verb-near-date rule, gated by a shrink-only ratchet baseline that a
    corpus-wide widening would break. A bare "PM ruling" with none of these
    three signals on the line is left unflagged, on the working assumption
    that it is bare provenance for a still-live rule; this is a probe-corpus
    finding, not a proof — the reversal-verb sample above is not exhaustive,
    so a dateless reversal narrated with some other verb can still pass
    through unflagged. Even with a date or a verb signal present, the phrase
    still cannot tell bare dated provenance from reversal narration on its
    own — nothing about "PM ruling <date>" itself names what changed, and a
    dateless history/reversal verb near the phrase is exactly the
    reversal-narration shape — so both keep landing in AMBIGUOUS rather
    than being resolved automatically to either bucket.
    `guard-doctrine-changelog-prose.py` reports this bucket with materially
    softer language ("worth a second look", not "is changelog prose") so
    the advisory doesn't overclaim what a bare-phrase match can actually
    establish.
  - Archived-schema read-tolerance notes — `'superseded' is retired
    (2026-06-26) but retained for archived read-tolerance` reads, on the
    high-confidence rule alone, as a textbook verb-near-date hit ("retired"
    fifteen tokens from a date). But the SUBSTANCE survives present-tense
    rewriting (drop the date, keep "retained for archived read-tolerance,"
    per CLAUDE.md § Conventions item 5: a live asymmetry, not history) — it
    is a genuinely different shape from ordinary reversal narration, not a
    edge case of it. Detected into its own ambiguous kind via a small
    cue-phrase set (`_READ_TOLERANCE_CUES`) checked on any line that would
    otherwise score high-confidence, so it downgrades rather than either
    silently passing or getting flagged with a message that tells the editor
    to do exactly the wrong thing (delete the substance instead of the
    date).

Neither ambiguous kind inflates the baseline silently: both carry their own
`kind` string (prefixed `ambiguous:`), so a baseline diff or a report reader
can see the ambiguous count separately from the high-confidence count rather
than the two collapsing into one number.

NOT a violation (see module docstring for the full false-positive-class
reasoning that motivated each exemption):
  - `<!-- spec-backlink: ... -->` / `<!-- Spec backlink: ... -->` / `>
    Spec backlink: ...` / `<!-- consumers: ... -->` lines — skipped
    outright, never scanned;
  - a bare `DR-\\d+` with no history verb nearby and no two-id chain — a live
    rule citation ("per DR-097, a bump owes a sibling notice"), not history;
  - anything inside a fenced code block, or the frontmatter block (first
    `---`-delimited region) — a fixture/example date in frontmatter is data,
    not narrated history;
  - a date embedded in a PATH or FILENAME token
    (`docs/plans/2026-07-31-foo.md`, `state/handoffs/2026-08-06-bar.md`) —
    the date-matching rule only fires on a token that, after stripping
    surrounding punctuation, is EXACTLY an ISO date and carries no `/`; a
    path/filename token fails that check because it carries extra
    characters (a slash, or a trailing `-slug.ext`) around the digits;
  - an operative threshold date ("Pre-2026-05-22 memos are grandfathered but
    PM-relay evidence still applies") — the date token here is fused to a
    `Pre-` prefix, so it never becomes a bare ISO-date token in the first
    place, and no history verb sits near it regardless.

#: The same narrowing `_USED_TO_STANDALONE` above already earned, applied to
#: the phrase that kept the blanket form. "no longer" has two populations, and
#: only one of them is changelog:
#:
#:   CHANGELOG — a definite subject in main-clause position narrates that THIS
#:   system changed: "The helper no longer unions mtime-dirty paths", "You no
#:   longer relay events", "it just no longer fires inside your commit".
#:
#:   FUNCTIONAL — a RELATIVE CLAUSE describes a runtime state the reader may
#:   encounter, which is present-tense prose about the world, not history about
#:   the doctrine: "an assigned memo that is no longer where the manifest says",
#:   "processes that no longer exist", "a wiring that no longer exists".
#:
#: The discriminator is structural, not semantic: the functional form puts a
#: relative pronoun immediately before the phrase, and the changelog form never
#: does — its subject sits in main-clause position. Same argument, same shape as
#: the `used to` narrowing, which is why this is a correction rather than a new
#: exemption class.
#:
#: DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE, in the direction of the guard FIRING. The window
#: is three words so a clause boundary cannot be spanned, and reduced relatives
#: ("a surface this repo no longer owns") and generic-subject modals ("a reader
#: can no longer tell") are NOT carved — they read as functional to a human but
#: have no structural marker, and inventing one would start carving the
#: changelog population too. Rewrite those in prose; do not widen this.

    the SEARCH, never to reconstruct the file's own byte-for-byte spelling
