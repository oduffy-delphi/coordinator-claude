# Native git pre-commit hook installed by a sibling repo's installer, not a hooks.json entrypoint.
"""Native git pre-commit hook: Layer 1 leg 1b of the doctrinal surface
weight ratchet -- the ONLY enforcing leg (leg 1a,
`guard-doctrine-surface-ratio.py`, is advisory-only, D7).

Spec: docs/plans/2026-08-13-doctrinal-surface-weight-ratchet.md, chunk C9b
(§ D2, D3, D7). Installer registration is chunk C9c, a sibling repo's
own installer -- this script ships complete and tested, but the
`.git/hooks/pre-commit` installed in this clone invokes a different
guard (`guard-phantom-staged-deletion-precommit.py`), not this one; the
sibling installer names this exact path (`coordinator/hooks/scripts/guard-
doctrine-surface-ratio.py` per its own gate registry -- see this repo's
plan body for the cross-repo contract note; do not rename either this
file or the leg-1a guard without a coordinated update on that side).

Why a git hook, not a second `PreToolUse` guard
--------------------------------------------------
`PreToolUse` fires before any commit exists and sees one tool call -- it
cannot net across a commit's edits (D7). At commit time the staged diff
exists, so per-commit netting is directly computable. Precedent:
`coordinator/hooks/hooks.json`'s foreign-platform-path guard makes the
identical two-leg argument (a `PreToolUse` guard "cannot see what is not
a tool call", its independent second leg is a native git pre-commit
hook that "survives a session where every Claude Code hook is dead").

THIS SCRIPT IS THE THIN, UNTESTED WRAPPER. It is a git hook, never
exercised by `pytest` collection (D7's "Consequence for the test plane")
-- its only job is: run the two real git subcommands, parse their output
into `(old_bytes, new_bytes, path)` rows, and hand them to the PURE,
directly-unit-tested functions in `_doctrine_surface_netting.py`
(`net_bytes_by_surface`, `net_bytes_by_file`) plus this module's own
carve-out logic (floor/accumulator, reasoned-growth marker, new-file
admission). Do not "simplify" this split by moving the netting logic
in here and running `git diff` internally from the tested module -- that
removes this plan's only test surface for leg 1b (see the netting
module's own docstring).

UNIT: BYTES, never a line-oriented diff
-------------------------------------------
`git diff --cached --numstat` emits LINE counts; leg 1a prices bytes
(`_sentinel_write_guard.reconstruct_after`'s byte-length delta). Billing
leg 1b off numstat would price one currency and bill another, silently
turn the 512 B floor into ~512 lines (~20 KB), mishandle numstat's
`-\t-` binary rows and its `old => new` / `{a => b}/c` rename path
forms, and be uncorrelated with byte deltas for exactly the
rewrite-to-tighten reflow motion this plan rewards. Instead:
`git diff --cached --raw -z -M` (`-M` collapses a rename into one row
with old+new paths, rather than delete-plus-add) enumerates staged paths
and old/new blob OIDs; `git cat-file -s <oid>` sizes each OID (the null
OID for an added/deleted side sizes as 0). A binary file's raw-diff row
still carries real OIDs (unlike `--numstat`'s `-\t-`), so `cat-file -s`
sizes it exactly like text -- no special-casing needed. A rename row's
path is the NEW path (the one `surface_of` buckets against).

Exit-code discipline
-----------------------
Exits 0 (allow) or 1 (block) ONLY -- never a raw propagated subprocess
code, mirroring the sibling repo's own installer wrapper's exit-code-
clamping discipline (see C9c). That installer wrapper additionally
clamps whatever this script exits, so an internal failure here is free
to fall through to the fail-open path below without bricking the
harness -- but this script clamps anyway, defensively, rather than
depending on that clamp alone.

Fail-open, not fail-closed, on any internal error (subprocess failure,
unreadable baseline, unparseable diff row) -- a defect in this
enforcing leg must not become a universal commit block; it degrades to
"leg 1b did not run this commit," same posture as leg 1a's own
fail-open guards. **This posture is scoped to the RATIO predicate only
-- see the admission leg below, which deliberately does NOT inherit it.**

ADMISSION LEG (C7 hole #1, `state/bug-backlog/2026-08-29-tool-call-
guards-are-blind-to-the-op-pa-3f8d21c07b45.yaml`, settled via
`coordinator/docs/wiki/guard-trigger-class-table.md` row #1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
`guard-doctrine-surface-bash-write.py` (`PreToolUse Bash|PowerShell`) and
`check-claude-md-size.py` (`PreToolUse Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) are both
TOOL-CALL guards: neither fires when an engine op rewrites a
`_claude_md_ledger.GOVERNED_AUTHORING_SURFACES` file via a direct in-process
`write_text`/`open(...,'w')` call, because that write is never a tool call
at all. `_admission_denials_for_governed_surfaces` below is the second leg
that closes this: it runs the SAME `_claude_md_ledger.admission_check_for_
surface` predicate the Write/Edit hook uses, against the staged diff, so an
op-driven write is admission-checked the moment it is committed -- which an
op-driven write always eventually is (that is the entire mechanism by which
it becomes durable and travels).

WHY THIS RIDES *THIS* SCRIPT rather than a new, separate pre-commit gate:
the actual `.git/hooks/pre-commit` dispatch is wired by claude-klabauter's
`coordinator_core.ops.install_doe_claude_precommit_hook._GATE_REGISTRY` (see
`coordinator/tests/test_doe_precommit_installer_registration.py`), a
cross-repo file this repo cannot add an entry to unilaterally. A brand-new
sibling script here would ship complete and tested and NEVER ACTUALLY RUN
-- exactly the shape this script's own opening paragraph already warns
about for a *rename* of this file ("do not rename... without a coordinated
update on that side"), and exactly the silently-degraded-instrument shape
this hole was found by. Riding the one gate the installer already invokes
is the only home on this side of that boundary that is genuinely reachable
without a coordinated claude-klabauter-side change.

WHY THIS LEG DOES NOT SHARE THE RATIO PREDICATE'S FAIL-OPEN POSTURE: the
ratio predicate above prices bloat -- its worst internal-failure case is a
missed ratchet, recoverable the next commit, so "the leg didn't run" is an
acceptable degraded mode. The admission leg instead makes a binary
admission decision (classify-or-refuse) on the single highest-blast-radius
surface in the fleet (the always-on boot payload every agent reads). For
THIS decision, "the leg didn't run" and "the leg ran and approved" must
never look the same to whoever relies on it -- so a missing/unreadable
per-surface ledger, or any other failure while evaluating a touched
governed surface, DENIES with an explicit "could not complete" message
rather than falling through to allow. `_admission_denials_for_governed_
surfaces` therefore does its own fail-closed error handling internally and
is deliberately kept OUTSIDE every `except Exception: return 0` branch in
`main` below.

RESIDUAL GAP, named rather than hidden: a native `pre-commit` hook is
skipped by `git commit --no-verify`, by `-c core.hooksPath=<empty>` (see the
bug row's own premise correction -- one op,
`coordinator_core.ops.tracker.push_suggestion._commit_envelope`, uses this
deliberately, though not against a governed surface today), and, more
fundamentally, by ANY commit landed via `git commit-tree` + `update-ref`
plumbing rather than porcelain `git commit` -- plumbing that never invokes
`pre-commit` at all, hooksPath or not (observed in
`coordinator_core.ops.propagate_body._commit_delivery`'s own docstring:
"plumbing that runs NO git hooks"). None of that op's writes are validated
to land inside `GOVERNED_AUTHORING_SURFACES` (its target is strictly
`state/handoffs/*.md`), so this gap does not currently touch this leg's
subject -- but the same op-authored-then-self-committed-via-plumbing shape
would evade this leg exactly as it evades pre-commit generally, and any
future op that both (a) writes a governed surface and (b) lands its own
commit via plumbing would need a different enforcement point than this one.
