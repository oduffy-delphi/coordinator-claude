"""SessionStart async fan-in dispatcher -- two hooks.json SessionStart
registrations, one interpreter, source-gated. Registered `async: true`.

Folds `session-start-register-doe-claude-root.py` (previously matcher
`startup|resume|clear|compact|fork`) and `session-start-repair-prepare-
commit-msg-hook.py` (previously matcher `startup` only) into ONE `python3`
process, registered ASYNC on the union of their prior matchers
(`startup|resume|clear|compact|fork`). Both prior hooks were ALREADY async
in the manifest: neither produces context-bound stdout (their whole value
is a side-effect write -- a machine-local registry self-heal for the
former, a git `prepare-commit-msg` shim self-repair for the latter), so
this fold keeps both off first-token boot latency exactly as before.

WHY A SEPARATE FILE FROM `sessionstart-dispatch.py` (not one dispatcher for
all eight). `hooks.json` gives one `async` flag per command entry, not per
guard -- a single process cannot be registered both sync and async at once.
Folding an async-only guard into the sync dispatcher would force it
synchronous (added boot-blocking latency, a real behaviour change); folding
these two async guards into the sync dispatcher would have the same effect
in the other direction. Keeping the sync/async split as two files preserves
every guard's original blocking behaviour exactly -- a hosting change only,
never a policy change, matching this repo's fan-in precedent (`stop-
dispatch.py`, `preuse-agent-dispatch.py`).

SOURCE-GATING. `session-start-register-doe-claude-root.py`'s own matcher
equalled this dispatcher's matcher exactly (`startup|resume|clear|compact|
fork`), so it needs no gating -- it always runs. `session-start-repair-
prepare-commit-msg-hook.py` fired on `startup` only; gated here to
`source == "startup"` so it does not newly fire on resume/clear/compact/
fork. Same source rule as the sync dispatcher: an ABSENT/empty `source` runs
both guards rather than narrowing on a missing signal, while a NON-EMPTY but
unrecognised one skips both -- matching what the pre-fold registrations did,
since the harness matcher gate would not have fired them either. Unreachable
until a harness release adds a sixth source value and someone widens the
hooks.json matcher without widening the `sources` sets below; the cohort
would then go silent, so `_UNMATCHED_SOURCE_BREADCRUMB` makes that loud.
Read the sync dispatcher's docstring for the full reasoning.

Both guards are exception-isolated (`try/except BaseException`, stderr
skipped-list breadcrumb) though async stdout/stderr is discarded by the
harness -- kept for parity with every other dispatcher in this repo and
because a raised exception here still costs a bad exit code recorded by
whatever observes async hook completion, however little that is acted on
today.
