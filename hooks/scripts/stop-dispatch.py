"""Stop-event fan-in dispatcher -- the Stop registrations, one interpreter.

Folds `runtime-tripwire-em-check.py`, `nudge-harness-directive-dispatch.py`,
`nudge-unrouted-sizing.py`, `watchdog-undischarged-next-move.py`,
`guard-manufactured-blocker.py`, and `stop-em-report-altitude.py` into ONE
`python3` process on the Stop event, following the registry +
lazy-scope-descriptor pattern `preuse-write-dispatch.py` / `_guard_runner.py`
already ships (fan-in WITHIN one event, never pooling ACROSS events -- see
`test_bash_guard_hook_stays_per_event.py`, which this dispatcher does not
touch).

`stop-em-report-altitude.py` (the sixth entry, added after the MEASURED
figure below was taken) is the DoE-side wiring for the EM->PM comms-budget
advisory op `hooks.em_report_altitude` -- see that shim's own docstring for
its channel/no-op contract. Prior to this entry, that engine op had NO
DoE-side caller anywhere in this plugin and its advisory never fired; this
is NOT one of the five guards `runtime-tripwire-em-check.py` already
carries live, despite an earlier stale docstring clause here claiming
otherwise.

`group-em-park-spool.py` is the Group-EM wake's producer, registered LAST --
see its own module docstring for the full contract, and the REGISTRY comment
beside it for why the order is load-bearing.

MEASURED (state/audits/2026-08-16-doe-hook-consolidation-feasibility.md):
5 processes/477.9ms -> 1 process/110.7ms on the all-miss path (4.3x), min-of-15
round-robin interleaved. Prototype verified guard-by-guard against a real Stop
payload and a real 674KB transcript before this file was authored -- this is a
hosting change, not a policy change: same advisories, same text, same emission
conditions, same ordering and dedup as the five standalone scripts.

Aggregation contract, copied from `_stop_family_runner.run_stop_family_guards`:
CONCATENATE-ALL, never first-fires-wins. Combined exit is 2 if ANY guard
returned 2; combined stderr is every firing guard's text joined by a blank
line; stdout (the posture-scaled advisory channel two of these guards use) is
concatenated separately and always emitted. Every guard runs inside its own
`try/except BaseException` -- one guard crashing removes only that guard
(fail-open for it alone, with a stderr skipped-list breadcrumb), exactly as
both shipped runners do (`_guard_runner.run_guards`,
`_stop_family_runner.run_stop_family_guards` clause 5,
`preuse-write-dispatch._compose_skipped_guard_breadcrumb`).

Lazy scope descriptors: each guard carries an import-free `precondition(ctx)`;
a guard whose precondition misses is never imported at all -- the all-miss
path is what nearly every turn end actually is, and is the dispatcher's whole
win over the eager "same work, one process" figure (236.3ms).

Shared repo root: resolved ONCE via `_git_root_walk.git_root_walk()` (stdlib-
only, zero-spawn in-process parent walk) and handed to any guard module that
exposes its own `_git_root` name, replacing that module's own (already-mostly-
zero-spawn) resolution with the value this dispatcher already computed --
avoids `runtime-tripwire-em-check.py` re-walking the tree a second time in the
same process. Does NOT reintroduce a `git rev-parse` spawn anywhere.

`watchdog-undischarged-next-move.py` is ALSO registered on
PostToolUse(Skill|Agent) -- untouched by this dispatcher, which only replaces
its Stop-event registration.

`guard-kira-verdict-routed.py` (docs/plans/2026-08-30-kira-verdict-routing-
join-key.md chunk C5) hard-stops a close whose Kira (overengineering-
reviewer) verdict was never routed to review-integrator or a refactor
executor -- see that module's own docstring for the full detection contract.
Registered here, not on `postuse-stop-family-dispatch.py`, because that
runner's `GuardScopeDescriptor` matches `tool_input.file_path` and this
guard's predicate has no file-path key to match against -- registering it
there would fire zero times, forever
(`docs/research/spike-verdicts/2026-08-29-six-detectors-onto-stop-family-runner.md`).

Negative spec: do not add another guard here without updating this module's
docstring and the hooks.json comment naming the fold set; do not reintroduce a
`COORDINATOR_STOP_DISPATCH_LAZY`-style eager fallback path in production (the
lazy+shared-root config is the only shipped behaviour -- the eager mode lived
only in the feasibility prototype to produce an honest "same work" comparison
number and has no reason to exist here).

C2b restore procedure (asyncRewake stop-watcher, stood down 2026-07-31 per PM
ruling, script retained on disk untouched, not deleted): re-add a Stop
registration (matcher "", timeout 1800, async true, asyncRewake true, invoking
`runtime-tripwire-stop-watcher.py` via the standard runpy trampoline every
other hooks.json entry uses). There is no longer a constant to flip: the
`_SUBAGENT_OVERRUN_TRIPWIRE_ENABLED` gate and the ~530 lines it guarded were
excised from `runtime-tripwire-em-check.py` at `2b16d4db8`, so a restore means
reconstituting that code from git history -- recipe preserved verbatim in
`archive/debt-backlog/2026-08/2026-08-29-runtime-tripwire-em-check-py-four-overengin-a1f27c2e8c.yaml`
-- and it still waits on the engine-side durable subagent-arrival record that
was always its prerequisite. That script's remaining advisories (push-failure /
hooks.json-staleness / zero-tool-use / session-baton-mint) are unrelated and
stay live regardless.
