"""Stop-hook guard -- hard-stop a close whose Kira (overengineering-reviewer)
verdict was never routed anywhere.

Spec: docs/plans/2026-08-30-kira-verdict-routing-join-key.md (chunk C5).
Dispatch brief: state/dispatch-briefs/2026-08-30-kira-verdict-routing-join-key/C5.md

THE PROBLEM. `/workstream-complete` doctrine is emphatic that Kira fires on
every close, that her findings route through `review-integrator`
unconditionally, and that a `rebuild_recommended: true` verdict routes
instead to an executor carrying a refactor remit -- but none of that was
ever mechanical. C1 gave Kira a terminal-stamp contract (`findings_count`
and the `rebuild_recommended`/`rebuild_rationale`/`rebuild_scope` delta,
lifted to top-level frontmatter); C2/C3 gave review-integrator and the
refactor executor route an `integrated_from` stamp naming the Kira
sidecar(s) they answered; C4 typed all of it in
`review-findings.schema.json`. This module is the first thing that
actually READS those stamps and can hard-stop a close that skipped the
routing they encode. See spec for the full stamp shape -- this guard's
own read set is exactly the five facts named below.

WHY `stop-dispatch.py`, NOT `postuse-stop-family-dispatch.py`. The latter is
registered on PostToolUse and gated by `GuardScopeDescriptor` file-path
matching against `tool_input.file_path` -- a session-level predicate like
this one has no file-path key to match, so an entry there registers cleanly
and then fires zero times, forever (see
`docs/research/spike-verdicts/2026-08-29-six-detectors-onto-stop-family-runner.md`,
verdict `not-viable`, for exactly this enrolment shape already having been
tried once). `stop-dispatch.py` is the single Stop entrypoint: its `main()`
returns 2 if any registered `StopGuard` fires, which IS the hard stop this
guard exists to deliver.

TRIGGER SCOPE -- why this must not fire on every Stop. Every peer blocking
guard already registered in `stop-dispatch.py` (`_pre_manufactured_blocker`,
`_pre_em_report_altitude`) begins its precondition with the same two-leg
check this guard's `main()` repeats: `agent_id` present means this Stop
belongs to a SUBAGENT, not the EM -- including Kira's own Stop, before any
integrator could possibly have run yet -- and `stop_hook_active` means this
is a re-entrant Stop the platform is already replaying, where re-blocking
would spin past `CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP` rather than deliver a
one-shot-per-turn block. Both legs are the platform contract for any
blocking Stop hook (`claude-code-platform-gotchas.md:790`), not an
implementation detail this module could shortcut.

CONTRACT_EPOCH -- narrow by construction. This guard only ever lists the
CURRENT session's own share dir, so the only sidecar that can be both
pre-contract and visible here is one written by this same session before
the epoch (a session open across the boundary) -- an already-closing
window, not a standing one. `_postdates_epoch` draws that line and fails
toward in-scope on a missing `spawned_at`. Delete `_CONTRACT_EPOCH_ISO`
and `_postdates_epoch` once no session predating 2026-08-30 can still
close.

THE DECISION -- entirely from frontmatter, never from a sidecar body:
  1. No Kira sidecar in the session share dir, but other review activity
     is present -> BLOCK (a close that reviewed something owed Kira a run
     too).
  2. A Kira sidecar carrying `findings_count > 0` with no sibling sidecar
     stamping `integrated_from` naming it -> BLOCK. The owed route is
     named unconditionally in the message (review-integrator, or a
     refactor executor if the verdict recommended a rebuild) -- an
     unanswered ordinary verdict and an unanswered rebuild verdict are
     the same failure: an unrouted Kira sidecar.

A third condition -- blocking a rebuild verdict answered by BOTH an
integrator AND a refactor executor -- was cut (staff-eng review,
2026-08-30): it could only fire when both answering agents had already
stamped `integrated_from` correctly, which is the exact compliance whose
absence is the problem this guard exists to catch; condition 2 already
covers the unanswered case.

NO WARN TIER, NO ENV ESCAPE, NO `--force`. If the guard seems to need an off
switch the design is wrong -- widen the epoch or the detection instead of
adding one.

Contract:
  stdin   -- Stop JSON (session_id, transcript_path, cwd, stop_hook_active, agent_id...)
  stdout  -- a could-not-evaluate advisory breadcrumb on a fail-open path
             only (stdin unreadable, repo root unresolvable, share dir
             unlistable); silent on every clean-pass or BLOCK outcome
  stderr  -- the BLOCK message, only when the guard fires
  exit 2  -- an unrouted (or over-routed) Kira verdict was found this Stop
  exit 0  -- every other path, including every failure path (fail-open)

Graceful degradation: any failure to read stdin, resolve the repo root, or
list/parse the session share directory falls through to a silent exit 0 --
this guard can only ever block on a POSITIVELY-read frontmatter fact, never
on its own inability to read one.
