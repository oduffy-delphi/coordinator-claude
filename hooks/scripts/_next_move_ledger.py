"""Per-session ledger of resolved-but-undischarged next moves.

Spec backlink: docs/plans/2026-08-10-posture-scaled-autonomous-disposition.md
(chunk C3).

Store for `watchdog-undischarged-next-move.py`. An "obligation" is a
machine-resolved next action the EM has not yet invoked -- opened by a
PostToolUse observation of a seam-opening call, discharged by a PostToolUse
observation of the matching terminal call. Nothing here infers state from
timing, idle duration, or transcript shape; every mutation is triggered by a
concrete tool-call observation the caller already has in hand.

Record shape (one per obligation, JSON-serialised):
  {obligation_id, seam, next_action, opened_at, progressed_at|null, discharged_at|null, fired}

Storage: `.coordinator-local/subagent-share/<session-id>/next-move-ledger.jsonl`
-- the machinery root the engine relocated to on 2026-09-02
(`coordinator_core/session/machinery_paths.py::machinery_root`). The retired
root was `state/subagent-share/<session-id>/next-move-ledger.jsonl`, the
existing per-session bookkeeping convention (see
`state/subagent-share/<session-id>/advisory-fire-counts.jsonl` for the same
shape used elsewhere) -- not a new path convention. This module is a stdlib-
only hook-path module (no `coordinator_core` import), so it duplicates the
new leaf spelling rather than importing the engine's accessor -- see
`_find_repo_root`'s own docstring for the same constraint applied to root
resolution. The whole ledger is rewritten on each mutation
(open/discharge/mark-fired): per-session record counts are tiny (at most
three concurrent obligations, per the static seam table), so this is not a
hot-path cost concern.

Windows-safe throughout: paths built via `os.path.join`/`pathlib`, no `/tmp`
literal, home resolution via `os.path.expanduser("~")` where needed.

    THE ONE SIGNAL NOT WRITTEN AT A BOUNDARY. Every other liveness signal
    either plane can read -- transcript mtime, subagent sidecar mtime,
    `receiver-state.json`, hook-write timestamps -- is written at the END of a
    unit of work, so they all go quiet together and cannot arbitrate between
    each other. A session waiting on a named peer therefore ages identically
    on every field to one that has stopped. This record is written at the
    moment of blocking, by the party that knows it is blocking, before the
    silence starts; that is the whole reason it can say something the others
    cannot. It is not an inference and nothing here derives it from timing.

    This precision holds for a first, uninterrupted fold. It does NOT hold
    across a crash-and-replay of the intake drain: a "blocked" row's
    `emitted_at` is provenance only (never used for ordering, per the intake
    schema table), so a replay after a partially-committed fold re-stamps
    `blocked_at` with the moment of the REPLAY, which can be several drain
    cycles later than the producer's original blocking moment. Callers doing
    precise arbitration against other liveness signals should treat
    `blocked_at` as "blocked, as of at least this stamp" rather than an exact
    original timestamp.

    THE ADDRESS IS A SESSION ID, NEVER A BARE PEER NAME. A name re-points to a
    new session with no event and no visible difference, so a `blocked_on`
    name read an hour later can name a session that has exited or, worse, a
    different one that now answers to it -- the hazard
    `read_pass.resolve_addressee` refuses on the send path, arriving here in a
    stored field instead. `blocked_on_name` rides along for a human reading
    the row; only the id identifies. Tripwire:
    `A-PEER-NAME-IS-NOT-A-STABLE-ADDRESS`.

    Cleared by the next `progress` or `discharge`: a stale block reads as a
    live one, which is the confirming-direction failure this field exists to
    remove.

    NO READER ON THIS PLANE, BY DESIGN -- NOT DEAD CODE. This op family has
    zero consumers under `coordinator/`: no rendered surface in this repo
    reads `blocked_at`/`blocked_on_session_id`/`blocked_on_name`. Its
    consumer is the engine plane: `claude-klabauter-em` requested this op by
    memo, and the folding/read side lives there, not here -- this repo is
    the ledger's sole WRITER for this op, the same relationship it already
    has with the intake side of `_next_move_ledger.py`. See
    `coordinator/docs/wiki/obligations-inbound-intake.md` for the contract.
    A future reader with a dead-code eye: check that wiki before deleting --
    a write-only field with no local consumer is the correct shape here, not
    a defect.

# THREE FAILURE-PATH RULES, each load-bearing:

# 1. A TRAILING partial line is tolerated; a malformed line MID-FILE is not.
#    A torn last line is a producer caught mid-append and costs one row. A
#    malformed line with rows after it is a producer BUG, and silently
#    skipping it would keep that bug invisible for as long as it kept
#    shipping. Such lines are quarantined verbatim to
#    `obligations-inbound.rejected.jsonl` and counted in the drain report --
#    visible on disk, without stalling the fold behind a row nobody is coming
#    to fix.
#
# 2. The claim uses a FIXED `.draining` suffix, drained on startup. A
#    timestamped or pid-stamped name would leave a fold that died partway
#    orphaning its rows under a name nothing ever looks for again; a fixed
#    name means the next drain finds them.
#
# 3. The drained file is deleted only AFTER the fold has committed. Deleting
#    first means a failed write loses the rows outright; deleting after costs
#    at worst a replay, and every fold op is idempotent -- `open_obligation`
#    dedupes on `obligation_id` and the stamps re-stamp.
#
# No cross-process lock. Concurrent drainers are safe by that same
# idempotence: the `O_EXCL` claim below serialises the common case, and a
# drainer that cannot claim defers to the next drain rather than replacing an
# unread `.draining` file.
