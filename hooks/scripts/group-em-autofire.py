"""UserPromptExpansion auto-fire hook for Group EM entry (naked Python, no bash).

Purpose: when a session types `/group-em`, this hook fires ahead of
`UserPromptSubmit`, runs the entry op (`coordinator/bin/group-em-enter.py`),
and injects the assembled result as `additionalContext` — so the Group EM is
already claimed and the roster and digest already built by the time the
session's own turn begins. Without it, `SKILL.md` can only *tell* the reading
session to run a command, which is the discharge-test failure the entry op was
built to close: a skill body is a document, and a mode nobody fires is a mode
assembled from memory.

This is the fourth `UserPromptExpansion` auto-fire in this directory and
follows `pickup-autofire.py` / `mise-autofire.py` exactly — same bare-verb
normalization, same fail-open discipline, same envelope. It is not new
infrastructure.

Contract (mirrors the sibling hooks in this directory):
  stdin   -- UserPromptExpansion JSON (command_name, command_args, cwd,
             session_id, prompt_id, ...)
  stdout  -- one `hookSpecificOutput` JSON envelope with `additionalContext`
             when a `group-em` verb was matched and entry produced a result;
             NOTHING otherwise (silent pass)
  exit 0  -- always. Never a blocking gate on the session's own prompt.

THE ENTRY OP MUTATES, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Unlike a brief-computing hook,
this one claims the Group EM nomination as a side effect. That is exactly what
`/group-em` invocation means — the skill is PM-gated at the point a human types
it, so firing on the typed verb inherits that gate rather than inventing one.
It fires on nothing else: no `Stop` trigger, no timer, no other command. Wiring
it to anything but the typed verb would re-derive the stood-down watcher that
`SKILL.md` § Anti-scope forbids.

SESSION ID IS PROPAGATED, NEVER AMBIENT. The payload carries the originating
`session_id`; it is passed explicitly via `--session-id`. The entry op would
otherwise read `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` from this hook process's environment, which
is not reliably the invoking session's under concurrency — and a Group EM claimed
under the wrong id is worse than no claim, because it looks correct.

A REFUSAL IS REPORTED, NEVER SWALLOWED. Exit 5 (a live incumbent), exit 6 (an
engine that returned a digest under a refused standing) and exit 7 (unreachable
engine, no silent fallback) each produce their own `additionalContext` naming
what happened. A hook that fired, was refused, and said nothing would leave the
session believing it holds a Group EM it does not.

NEGATIVE SPEC — what this hook deliberately does NOT do:

- **Never passes `--supersede`.** Taking the role from a live peer is
  direction-class and belongs to a human. The hook reports the refusal and the
  incumbent; it never resolves it.
- **Never passes `--local`.** The engine path is the default and an
  unreachable engine refuses. A hook silently selecting the divergent
  in-tree ladder is precisely the fallback the CLI exists to refuse.
- **Never sends to a peer.** It assembles. `gate1`/`gate2` stay unresolved and
  the injected text says so; every send remains an explicit per-send act.
- **Never blocks.** Any failure — unreadable stdin, unresolvable CLI, timeout,
  malformed output — degrades to silence and exit 0.
