"""Select and throttle the Group EM's nudge population (roadmap `gem-01`,
baton `gem-14`).

Rationale, measurements, the superseded first shape, and the PM ruling that
licensed this: `docs/decisions/DR-group-em-send-narrows-on-the-obligation-ledger.md`.
Tripwire: `A-PAUSED-ROSTER-IS-NOT-A-NUDGE-LIST`. The rules alone are below.

**It selects and throttles. It does not send.** GATE 1/GATE 2 are declared
per entry, in prose, by the Group EM. GATE 2 has no instrument, so no code can
clear it; a module that sent anyway would clear a gate it cannot evaluate.

**The roster is the population** -- `read_pass` bounds it, a human adjudicates
it. This module adds throttling and the gate, never another filter.

**The obligation ledger ranks; it does not admit.** An undischarged, unfired
record orders the digest most-owed-first. `None` means no ledger exists at all
-- a producer coverage gap, never evidence the peer owes nothing, and never
grounds to exclude. Gating on it was built first and measured inert.

**The `fired` latch is honoured, not just `discharged_at`** -- the ledger
hook's own predicate (`discharged_at is None and not fired`), implemented here
rather than called, held equivalent against the real producer by a wire-path
test. A fired record already reached that peer once; re-presenting it is the
repeat-fire class AC6 forbids.

**Infers NOTHING.** Every input is a record something else concretely
observed. No elapsed-time, idle-duration, session-age, or transcript-shape
predicate exists in the eligibility path -- `send_suppression_reason`, the
admission rule the emission path calls, takes no clock; pinned. The one clock
is the cooldown, throttling this session's own offers, never a peer.

NEGATIVE SPEC -- deliberately absent:

- **No send, no write to any peer's state.** Only this session's own log.
- **No `PAUSED:away` nudge, ever** -- excluded by name and by allow-list, and
  reported as `never-send-reason` ahead of any bookkeeping cause. `away` was
  unobserved in the 2026-08-30 window, so the exclusion is structural and
  untested against live traffic.
- **No shouldn't-be adjudication.** An open obligation says the peer resolved
  a next move and has not invoked it -- not that it is stuck.
- **No GATE 2 instrument.** `peer_roster.status` is never read (negative-
  spec'd; 1465 s stale measured, unbounded to 6.9 h), and the obligation
  ledger is not repurposed as a receiver-state proxy -- it answers a different
  question. Every entry carries `gate1`/`gate2` as `None`.
- **No CPU-delta leg** -- the band-separation finding is RETRACTED.
- **No `Stop` registration**, no re-derivation of the stood-down watcher's
  restore recipe (AC6). Invoked from a PM-gated skill body, never a hook.
