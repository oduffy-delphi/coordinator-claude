# Execute Plan — End-to-End Plan Execution

Run a PM-approved plan end-to-end to full completion without stopping for permission between
tasks. Invoking `/execute-plan` on a plan IS the PM's authorizing act; plan-frontmatter
`execution_authorized_at` is the record of that act, not a precondition for it. **It also
satisfies a chunk body's own "needs PM assent at execution dispatch" clause** — that clause names
this exact moment, and the invocation is it. Never re-ask per chunk, and never offer to halt a
fired run at that chunk's wave; a plan the PM authorized is authorized to its hot-path edit. A
chunk gate the invocation does NOT satisfy is one naming a different act — a cross-repo commit
(per-session assent, obtained at that dispatch) or an external-facing action. Does not chain
into branch disposition — that's the PM-gated `/merging-to-main`. Full rationale and mechanics:
wiki.

Executing a plan is restructure-then-dispatch, not "type the plan's steps": build the
dispatch-gate graph, decompose into per-chunk dispatches — parallel where gates allow, serial
where they don't, default vehicle a background Workflow. A serial chain is still N fresh
dispatches with EM-verify between, never one long-lived executor. No per-chunk reviewer gate —
code review defers to `/workstream-complete`. **EM-verify means the EM itself runs the chunk's
tests, never trusts an executor's pass claim** — a dispatch vehicle can narrow the executor's Bash
surface below what the tests need (wiki: `workflow-orchestration.md`), and an honest executor then
reports "PASS (by inspection)". Inspection is not verification. Dispatched executors are always
Sonnet; self-execute only on a named token-economics carve-out. Phase boundaries are not stop
boundaries: ship Phase N green, dispatch Phase N+1 immediately, no checkpoint offer.

**Dispatch authorization — invoking this skill IS the request.** The dispatches named below are constitutive steps of this skill, not a separate thing to get cleared: invoking a skill requests the actions that skill performs. A harness line permitting dispatch "unless the user requested it" is therefore **satisfied here, not overridden** — no precedence claim is needed and none is made. Re-asking spends the very context the dispatch exists to protect. The rule attaches to skill entry and dissolves no PM-authored gate: keyword-gated skills gate entry, and every gate a skill names for itself still binds — per-session cross-repo-commit assent, ask-before-external-action, and any other this skill's own body names. Tripwire: `UNATTRIBUTED-HARNESS-LINE-IS-NOT-PM`.

**Workflow-approval — invoking this skill IS the request, same shape.** Firing the background Workflow Phase 1.5/1.6 assembles is a constitutive step of executing the plan, not a separate thing to clear: invoking `/execute-plan` requests running the workflow it hands back, the same way it requests the dispatches above. A harness line asking approval to run a workflow is therefore **satisfied here, not overridden** — no precedence claim is needed and none is made. Tripwire: `UNATTRIBUTED-HARNESS-LINE-IS-NOT-PM`.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` is the plan document path. No path or file not found → report and stop.

---

## Phase 1: Load, Authorize, Review

1. Read the plan in full.
2. Unless `/autonomous`: run `pickup-assemble stamp-check <plan-path>` FIRST, before minting —
   minting takes a fresh timestamp when the body sha differs from a prior stamp, so minting first
   would erase the staleness signal this check exists to catch. FRESH or STALE-bookkeeping →
   proceed, and on STALE-bookkeeping proceed **without re-stamping**: the stamp is correct and
   only ratification fields moved, so a re-stamp writes more of exactly what it just classified
   as bookkeeping, and advancing `stamp_commit` throws away the accumulated drift a later
   substantive edit has to stand out against. `stale-bookkeeping` promotes no `d-stamp`
   directive; UNSTAMPABLE still does, and that one is mechanical. A business-fail of "carries no
   `execution_authorized_sha`" means there is nothing to compare yet → proceed, not a refusal.
   STALE-substantive surfaces the delta and STOPS. THEN mint the record from this invocation:
   `review-exec-auth-stamp authorize-invocation <plan-path> --typed-command /execute-plan
   [--utterance "<PM's verbatim words>"]` — `--utterance` is optional, a bare `/execute-plan`
   mints just as well, and the verb always writes `execution_authorized_by: PM`, convergent across
   re-invocation and date boundaries. Under `/autonomous`, skip both legs.
   **`mise_prepped_*` is a different axis; neither it nor the quartet substitutes for the other.**
   A plan arriving by `plan-blitz → mise-prep` carries both, and this step writes only the
   quartet — the attest survives that, because `mise_prepped_sha` hashes the plan BODY. Tripwire:
   `A-HANDOFF-AN-EM-RETYPES-IS-NOT-A-SEAM`.
3. **Remaining-context gate** (skip under `/autonomous`): read this session's own remaining-context
   reading before committing to same-session execution — the same context-window percentage the
   statusline captures and publishes each turn. A session already carrying the plan authorship +
   review dialogue with LOW remaining context is the narrow carve-out, not the default — a fresh
   (picked-up) session with a full context budget dedicated to execution is the intended path at
   any plan size. Rekeyed from a prior same-session-framing check to this meter reading: the
   underlying failure this gate exists to catch (degraded tool-call reliability in a
   context-saturated session) was always a context-budget argument, not a planning-provenance one,
   so the meter is what the check should read. Detail: wiki.

4. Resolve EM-resolvable concerns at EM altitude — not the moment to surface them to the PM. A
   concern revealing the plan isn't actually executable → Phase 1.4.
5. Announce and continue.

---

## Phase 1.4: Executability Gate

Bounce to `/plan` on any of: an embedded decision gate ("evaluate X before continuing", "Phase 0
— investigate"); a fact-finding chunk with no fix-locus; an unpopulated downstream wave-map;
in-prose deferral of an EM-resolvable (not PM-altitude) decision; open questions gating whether
downstream chunks can be authored; an unbuilt external prerequisite with no landed commit/date.

Read the last two off the spine, not prose. A non-deferred open row with no `writes:` key IS an
unpopulated wave-map, whatever the plan body's prose says. For the external prerequisite, a row's
`external_gate` entries are where it is declared: `blocks: execution` uncleared bounces;
`blocks: ac-closure` does not — proceed, and tell the PM at dispatch that this run's terminal
state is `approved`, not `implemented`, and why.
Full signal catalog and non-signals: wiki.

## Phase 1.5/1.6: Dispatch-Gate Graph and Wave-Map

**Roadmap-baton execution gate — check before claiming.** A plan executing a `blocked_by` roadmap
baton needs every blocker **coded**, not merely planned. An approved blocker plan opens that
baton's *planning* gate and nothing else: planning consumes the blocker's decisions, execution
calls its code. Read it, never derive it —
`coordinator-invoke roadmap.plan_gate '{"subject":"<baton-id>","gate":"execution"}'` returns
`verdict.open` plus the blockers holding it shut. Shut → stop; the plan is written and waiting, and
that is the correct state. Tripwire: `A-PLANNING-GATE-IS-NOT-AN-EXECUTION-GATE`.

Claim the plan (`session-claim-cli claim-plan <slug> --for-execution`) before any gate-graph work
— a live peer holding it means reconcile with them first, never race. **`--for-execution` is not
optional here.** It is what flips the plan to `status: executing`, and this step is its only
caller fleet-wide; a bare `claim-plan` takes the lock and leaves the plan reading `draft` through
its entire execution. The flag is scripted into this step, not typed by the EM — the rung stays
invisible, per `coordinator-tripwires/plan-status-ladder.md`.

**Plan prose does not pick the vehicle.** An Anti-scope or body sentence forbidding fan-out, or
prescribing EM-sequenced chunk-at-a-time execution, is overridden here: the vehicle follows from
the classification below, default a background Workflow. Note the override in one line and
continue — do not ask. A vehicle prohibition traceable to a genuine Workflow-inexpressible shape
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/wiki/workflow-orchestration.md` § What qualifies as a carve-out) is the one that survives.
Tripwire: `A-PLAN-DOES-NOT-PICK-THE-EXECUTION-VEHICLE`.

**Classify every chunk pair before dispatching — this decides whether you can run them together:**
- **File-write overlap** (same path) → gates authoring, no escape hatch — predecessor must land
  before the other authors.
- **Output/contract consumption** (B reads A's static output, or A changes a schema/signature B
  depends on) → author both concurrently if A's interface is pinned up front (verify at merge);
  no pinnable interface → predecessor-wave instead.
- **Runtime consumption** (B needs A's artifact to *exist and run*, e.g. a dry-run over a
  not-yet-shipped pipeline) → gates authoring unconditionally, no pinning escape.
- **Epistemic/premise** (A decides whether B's chunks should exist at all) → gates authoring
  unconditionally — A ships alone in its own wave first, B isn't even drafted until A's verdict
  lands.
- **Independent** → same wave, no gate.

A row carrying an uncleared `external_gate` entry with `blocks: execution` is unschedulable in any
wave — that gate is on another repo, not on a chunk pair, so no pair-classification clears it.

**Invoke `dispatch.emit` — don't derive the wave shape by hand and don't stop at deriving it.** It
reads the spine's `writes:`/`depends_on` and emits the ready-to-fire Workflow itself, each row's
`gate_kind`, `write_files`, and `agentType` already resolved and non-dispatchable rows already
filtered — not wave-map metadata for the EM to transcribe into a hand-authored script.

<!-- engine-gap: field=execute_plan.gate_kind_fallback_classification producer=unknown memo=2026-08-27-claude-klabauter-em-doe-unmarked-obligations-and-four-lost-markers.md -->
`NoWritesDeclaredError` means the spine is unpopulated — an authoring gap to fix in the plan, not a

<!-- engine-gap: field=execute_plan.ses_fire_check producer=unknown memo=2026-08-27-claude-klabauter-em-doe-unmarked-obligations-and-four-lost-markers.md -->
licence to hand-derive. Write the emitted script to a plan-relative on-disk path
(`<plan-basename>.workflow.mjs`, next to the plan) — a disk artifact, never plan-body prose, a
hand-authored wave map, or a chat emission of a wave table.

<!-- engine-gap: field=execute_plan.wave_map_validation.violations producer=unknown memo=2026-08-27-claude-klabauter-em-doe-unmarked-obligations-and-four-lost-markers.md -->

**Emit and dispatch are ONE action, and the dispatch leg is not optional.** In an interactive
session the EM runs `python <plugin-root>/bin/emit-dispatch-workflow.py --plan <plan-path>`
(plugin-local, no settings-home launcher — resolve per `snippets/resolve-coordinator-bin.md`
§ CLIs with no launcher; never cwd-relative), then
calls `Workflow({scriptPath: "<emitted path>"})` in this session. The emitter's output is already a
valid `scriptPath` input — no flag, no re-authoring. That call carries the same imperative force as
the emit: it is not EM discretion about whether to dispatch, and it is not hand-dispatch — it is
the emitted script, one action. Emitting and stopping writes a script nothing runs — the exact
state that left a fireable `.mjs` sitting on disk against a PM-authorized plan while the EM
hand-dispatched the same work. **An emitted script is not a delivered dispatch.**

Firing in-session is what makes the run the operator's: visible and selectable in their workflow
list, inspectable while it runs, resumable via `resumeFromRunId` (same-session-only), running under
their permissions, costed to their session, completion arriving as a task notification.

**`--fire` is the headless and cron path only.** It hands the script to `engine_fire.fire_workflow`
(a module function — not a `workflow.fire` op dispatch, despite the dot-notation this doc used to
use), which spawns a detached `claude -p` child and returns a run handle
(`{"script": ..., "handle": {...}}`; the handle's `fire_id` is what `workflow.fire_status`
re-reads). The resulting workflow is native to that child, not to any operator: it runs under the
child's own `--allowedTools` (no `PowerShell`; denials surface only as `permission_denials` in the
final JSON envelope, which reads identically to a chunk that made no edit), the run cannot be
resumed, and the fire log is written only at process exit — so a live run and a killed one are
indistinguishable through it.
Correct where no session exists to call the tool, and wrong everywhere a session does.

**There is no hand-dispatch fallback.** If the dispatch refuses — the `Workflow` call, or on the
headless path a named fire-leg refusal (`ScriptNotFoundError`, `PluginDirResolutionError`,
`ConcurrencyCapExceededError`, `ChildSpawnFailedError`) — report it and stop. Hand-dispatching the
same chunks with the Agent tool after a refused or unattempted dispatch is the failure this whole
surface exists to prevent, and it is never the recovery. A concurrency-cap refusal means wait, not
dispatch by hand.

**A fifth state exists beyond the four named refusals: fired-then-died.** The four refusals above
are all fire-time — the child never started. A child that started and then died mid-run is
different: the fire log is written only at process exit, so nothing distinguishes a live run from
a killed one through the log alone. Check the returned handle's `log_size_bytes`: `0` is a free
liveness signal — the child has written nothing yet, whether because it is still starting or
because it died before its first write. Treat a stalled handle with `log_size_bytes: 0` past a
reasonable startup window as fired-then-died: report it and stop, the same as a fire-time refusal.

A workflow-spawned agent IS its declared `agentType` — the type propagates — but the catering
layered on top of it at dispatch time does not: no `contract_blocks`, no provisioned report
sidecar, no dispatched-worker role framing (measured both ways against a discriminator and the
catering trace, `state/audits/2026-08-18-contract-blocks-workflow-delivery.md`). That shapes what a
spawn-time catering fix must carry, not whether the emitted workflow gets fired.

Wave shape comes from the file-write graph, never the plan's section/theme structure — the op
derives it; a second derivation is a silently desyncing source of truth for a fact the graph
already knows. One dispatch per chunk inside the emitted script — never bundle serial chunks into
one long-lived executor; a serial dependency removes concurrency, not decomposition. Full taxonomy,
malformed-wave checks, sizing, and authoring mechanics: wiki.

**No checkpoint prompt; scripted gates still hold.** What roll-on removes is the EM checkpoint
prompt — the fired workflow does not pause to ask a human whether to continue, not before the
first phase and not between waves. What it does NOT remove: a `phase()`'s own deterministic gate
MAY still halt the run (`return { halted: ... }`, wiki: `workflow-orchestration.md`), and a halted
or edited phase resumes via `resumeFromRunId` without re-paying phases that already succeeded.
Removing the prompt is not removing the gates.

**One emit per plan — a partial re-run resumes, it does not re-emit.** The emitted script already
carries every open wave, preflight through terminal test phase; firing it once is the whole plan.
When a run halts — a `Commit wave N` phase with no `COMMIT-LANDED <sha>`, a BLOCKed executor — the
recovery is `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: <run>})` in the same session — but resume
alone does not recover. Resume serves the longest UNCHANGED prefix of `agent()` calls from cache,
and the commit agent that refused *completed*; its refusal is cached. Relaunching the script
untouched replays that cached refusal and re-halts at the same gate. **Edit the halting phase's
agent step first** — fix what the refusal named — then **re-stamp the receipt**, then resume; the
run id comes back in the `Workflow` tool result, not from anything the script can read about
itself. The re-stamp is not a formality: `block-workflow-foreign-emission.py` denies a fire whose
bytes differ from the receipt beside the script, and the edit is exactly that difference.
`emit-dispatch-workflow.py --restamp <script>` re-stamps it and prints the phase spine it
authorizes, refusing unless the receipt already names this session. A second
`emit-dispatch-workflow.py` is not the recovery: `read_spine` excludes rows whose `disposition` is
closed, so an emit against a plan whose early chunks have landed silently produces a narrowed
one-wave script, indistinguishable on disk from an emit that was always meant to be partial, and
re-pays the preflight and every phase that already succeeded. An `--out` naming a chunk id
(`<plan>.c9.workflow.mjs`) is the tell. Re-emit only when the spine itself changed — a row added, a
gate cleared, a `writes:` corrected — and name the change in the report. Tripwire:
`A-SECOND-EMIT-AFTER-A-PARTIAL-RUN-NARROWS-SILENTLY`.

**Watching without waiting — arm a `Monitor`, don't poll by hand.** Roll-on removes the checkpoint
prompt, not the EM's eyes on the run. Once the workflow is fired, arm the harness `Monitor` tool
against the run's own progress signal — the transcript directory's `journal.jsonl` plus the
harness's own completion report — with a command that surfaces phase-boundary and failure lines
(`persistent: true` for a run that outlives one Monitor window). Cover every terminal state a wave
can end in, not just success, per `Monitor`'s own filter-coverage guidance — a filter that only
matches the happy path stays silent through a stuck or crashed wave, which looks identical to
"still running." Notifications land asynchronously in chat while the EM keeps working; that
asynchrony is what keeps this from becoming a second checkpoint — the EM is never blocked waiting
on the monitor the way a checkpoint prompt blocks waiting on an answer. A stuck or failed wave
surfaces as a notification to act on (inspect disk, `resumeFromRunId`) the moment it lands, not
something the EM has to remember to go check.

Don't build a new watcher for this. `Monitor` already is the "eyes on it with a chron or
something" the PM asked for — no new script under `coordinator/bin/`, no new reporting format.
Contrast `coordinator/skills/strategic-self-description-refresh/SKILL.md`, which explicitly refuses
`CronCreate`/`RemoteTrigger` for its own ceremony gate: automating that gate would remove the human
decision it exists to force. A fired workflow has no such decision to protect — it already runs
unattended by design — so `Monitor` is the fit there and cron is not the shape to copy.

---

## Phase 2: Create Flight Recorder

TaskCreate: one task per plan phase/major task, added BENEATH the stage rows the sizing lobby
already opened (`skills/sizing/SKILL.md` § 4b) — the lobby is the single opener, and its
session-goal task is already `in_progress`. Entered without the lobby (no stage rows on the
list): open the recorder here instead, session goal plus phases, marked `in_progress`
immediately.
<!-- BEGIN task-tool-availability (synced from snippets/task-tool-availability.md) -->
`TaskCreate` absent from this session's surface (`ToolSearch("select:TaskCreate")` returns nothing)
→ fall back to `coordinator-tasks-mirror` for the same flight-recorder role; do not assume either
state without checking. When Task* is unavailable, dispatch the phases in order, waiting on each
completion notification — that is the ordering a `blockedBy` chain would otherwise express.
<!-- END task-tool-availability -->

Executing a plan in a repo other than the one this session is anchored in → pass
`coordinator-tasks-mirror --repo-root <plan's repo>`. Bare, the mirror resolves its root from cwd
and the repo-identity gate refuses the write as a MISMATCH — a deliberate cross-repo call is
otherwise indistinguishable from the `cd`-drift accident that gate exists to catch. The flag takes
the ungated EXPLICIT arm; it never softens the gate on the bare arm.

---

## Phase 3: Execute All Tasks

<!-- engine-gap: field=execute_plan.wave_boundary_gated_artifact_check producer=unknown memo=2026-08-27-claude-klabauter-em-doe-unmarked-obligations-and-four-lost-markers.md -->

Default: execute every task in sequence without stopping to ask. Per task: write-ahead (mark
`In progress` on disk + TaskUpdate `in_progress`) → execute (follow the plan, fix routine errors,
move on) → mark complete (on disk + TaskUpdate `completed`) → proceed immediately, including
across phase boundaries, same session, same flight recorder.

Mid-dispatch decisions are EM decisions — pick, record a one-line rationale inline, continue; only
the Phase 5 list escalates. A residual (a site the sweep missed, a fix wider than the AC) needs a
closed exit — dispatch it, add a spine row for the Phase 4 harvest, `coordinator-queue-append
--schema bug-backlog|debt-backlog|improvement-queue`, or take it to the PM. A written reason with
no queue id/spine row/commit behind it is not a routed item.

---

## Phase 4: Finalize and Report

**Precondition:** every wave-map chunk has landed, confirmed via the recovery triple.
Unconfirmed chunks → return to Phase 3. Leg 1 (chunk-id subject match) yields candidates, never a
verdict — corroborate against leg 2 or leg 3.

**`close-out-and-stamp` reads no commit message at all.** The commit-subject/`Deliverable-Id`-trailer
join was deleted — not narrowed — on measured low recall; its absence is a
ruling, so do not restore it as an oversight. Two evidence paths survive, both pure sha-ancestry
checks: a `disposition: coded` spine row's own `disposition_ref`, and, for a plan predating the
`## Tasks` spine, its `## Dispatch Ledger` table's `committed <sha>` cells. Neither infers
completion from a commit message, so a correct subject and a correct trailer are not, together or
alone, evidence that any row shipped.

**The `## Tasks` spine is the only row family close-out reads.** Delivery evidence is the
falsifier delta on `prime_exit_criterion` — its verdict, not a row's ticked-or-open state, is what
discharges the plan. Tripwire: `AN-UNTICKED-AC-CELL-CARRIES-NO-INFORMATION`.

**Before any cleanup:** `coordinator-harvest-deferrals --plan "$ARGUMENTS"`, surfacing its
`"Queued N ..."` line even on `Queued 0`. A `defer` grouping approval (or legacy
`pm_approved: true`) is a claim of ratification the harvest selects on, not something this step
may stamp — closing a row mid-execution is a scope decision that needs the PM first.

**Commit sequence, two commits, never one — the resolve step below writes the plan, not a third
commit:**
1. Land the chunk work in your own scoped commit(s) — explicit pathspec, never `git add -A`. The
   `prepare-commit-msg` hook attaches the `Deliverable-Id:` trailer when you commit per
   `snippets/scoped-commit-route.md`; never hand-add it. The trailer is provenance for other
   consumers — close-out does not read it, so its presence proves nothing about delivery and its
   absence stamps nothing partial.
2. Resolve each landed row's own `disposition_ref`, the only thing close-out counts:
   `plan-tasks-resolve --plan "$ARGUMENTS" --id <row> --coded <sha> --disposition-detail "<why>"`,
   per row, then close out. Failure signature — `missing_chunk_ids` at exit 0 over a range that
   provably holds every chunk SHA — means unresolved rows, not missing trailers and not a range
   problem; resolve and re-run, never rewrite shared history. Record the sha where the work
   actually landed: `disposition_ref` is hand-written and the anti-self-attestation gate cannot
   catch a row pointing at a peer's commit, since that commit is an ancestor of `HEAD` too — a
   spine can be fully green and fully misattributed.
3. Re-run `prime_exit_criterion.falsifier.how` against `HEAD`, paste its raw output into
   `exit_criterion_met.falsifier_output`, and judge it against
   `prime_exit_criterion.falsifier.expected_when_true` — never against `baseline_output`. Record
   the verdict in `exit_criterion_met.falsifier_verdict` (`pass`/`fail`); the gate refuses the
   stamp unless it is `pass`. A changed-but-non-matching output is still a `fail`: non-inertness
   alone does not prove the criterion, so no separate zero-movement rule is needed — an unchanged
   output already fails the same check. `exit_criterion_met.prose` is the signature tying that
   verdict to the prime exit criterion, not a substitute for it. Verdict `fail` →
   `asserted: false`, Phase-5-halted, no stamp.
3.5. **Promote the falsifier, when it promotes.** An executable, deterministic falsifier graduates
   into the repo's test suite: record `promotion: promoted` and `promoted_to: <test path>`, or
   `promotion: partial` with the path the promoted portion landed at. A falsifier that was already
   a standing test before the plan records `promotion: already-in-suite` and no `promoted_to` —
   nothing graduated, and the standing test it already was goes in `promotion_reason`. The shape is red-green at plan
   altitude — the baseline already proved it fails before the work, so the promoted test arrives
   with its red state demonstrated, which is more than most tests can say. PROMOTION IS AN
   OUTCOME, NOT A GATE: a one-shot corpus query, a manual observation, or a measurement against a
   live index records `promotion: not-applicable` plus a reason, and close-out accepts it. Do NOT
   make promotability a precondition for the stamp — EMs would then choose falsifiers for their
   filing convenience rather than for what they actually falsify, which is the vacuous-AC failure
   wearing a new costume.
3.6. **Adversarial criterion-only reader, M+ plans that went green first time only.** M+ per
   `sizing_object.estimate.tshirt` (§ Proportionality; an S-lane spec-dispatch never gets this) AND
   every wave-map chunk landed without an executor BLOCKing on this run — dispatch one reader that
   receives only the prime exit criterion statement and `HEAD`, and answers one question: does HEAD
   do this? Current review effort concentrates where execution stumbles; a plan that halts is
   self-flagging, and the plan that sails is the one nobody re-reads.
   **THE DENIAL LIST IS THE MECHANISM AND MUST BE EXPLICIT IN THE DISPATCH, not implied:** no plan
   body, no AC table, no chunk bodies, no run reports, no reviewer sidecars. A reader who never sees
   AC3 cannot be misled by AC3 — that is the entire value, and a well-meaning "here is the context
   you need" destroys it.
4. `close-out-and-stamp "$ARGUMENTS"` — stamps `status: implemented` and commits the plan path
   (full-plan-shipped), or reports remaining uncommitted chunks and skips the stamp
   (Phase-5-halted). Folding the stamp into your own commit is acceptable — state that you did.

**Offer, stamp-aware, never parroted.** The branch is whether step 4 stamped `implemented`, never
how shipped the session feels. Stamped → offer `/workstream-complete`, note
`/merging-to-main`/`/workday-complete` ship it. Unstamped for **any** reason — Phase 5 halt, open
spine row, a leg unmet in another repo → do not offer `/workstream-complete`; offer
resolve-and-resume, `/handoff`, or commit-and-stop. An accurate "partial and honest" report does not
earn the offer. Never auto-invoke any of those or `coordinator:finishing-a-development-branch`.
Tripwire: `AN-HONEST-INCOMPLETE-DOES-NOT-EARN-THE-WRAP-OFFER`.

**A cross-repo leg names its failing conjunct, not its repo** — *undeclared*, *unaddressed*, or
*unanswered* per `coordinator/snippets/cross-repo-block-exchange.md`. Tripwire:
`A-SENT-MEMO-IS-NOT-AN-EXCHANGE`.

---

## Phase 5: When to Stop — PM-Only Emergencies

The default is complete the plan. Stop only for: **external trust surface change**
(user-visible behavior, privacy, security boundary, billing/pricing/onboarding, or any
externally-observable contract the plan didn't call out); **plan-invalidating substrate change**
(disk state changed since drafting in a way that makes the plan structurally wrong — bounce to
`/plan`); **scope explosion** (≥3× anticipated size, no 5-15min-chunk decomposition articulable
for the remainder — route back to `/plan`); **unauthorized irreversible action required**
(destructive op, force-push, cross-repo write to a sibling's code, credential/cookie write, or
anything gated by `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § Executing actions with care); **discovery the plan
would ship something not authorized** (approved on premise X, execution reveals it would also do
Y, and Y is not a mechanical consequence of X).

Not on the list (EM decisions, made inline): accumulating patches, ambiguity, structural
verification failure (`/systematic-debugging`), routine fixable errors, minor judgment calls,
wanting to check in. Record `Tried:/Failed:` in the plan doc and the task's
`metadata.tried_and_abandoned`. Surface with a recommendation, not a question.

---

## Relationship to Other Commands

Default upstream entry is `/handoff` + `/pickup`: review can stamp `execution_authorized_at` as
supporting evidence and writes an execution handoff. `/enrich-and-review` runs before
dispatch when the plan isn't chunk-ready; `/review-code` is an optional post-execution pass. `coordinator:workstream-complete`
is offered, never auto-invoked, in Phase 4; `coordinator:finishing-a-development-branch` is not
chained here — reached separately via `/merging-to-main`. Full failure-mode table: wiki.
